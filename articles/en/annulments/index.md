No. Jesus allows for physical separation in Matthew 19:9, but not for divorce 
and remarriage in Luke 16:18. Canon Law allows for "divortium imperfectum" and 
a ban on sacraments for the guilty party - however, what God has put together 
let no man separate. 

# Are Annulments Catholic?

It’s a scenario tragically familiar to many Catholic husbands today: your wife, 
the woman you swore vows with before God, goes off the rails (or vice versa). 
Infidelity, emotional abuse, financial ruin, or a complete abandonment of his / her duties. 

You’re trying to hold it together for the kids, your job, your sanity, but you're stuck. 
Secular advice on YouTube screams "take your power back, divorce her!" and the MGTOW 
group says "see, that's why it's bad to get married in the first place!". So, how does the
Church answer this problem?

## Does Jesus allow divorce?

As Catholics, we know divorce is not an option and marriage is the only licit way
to make children. So, what then? The modern Church points to one door: annulment - a piece of 
paper stating that, for certain reasons, the partners weren't clear what a marriage was 
when they said their vows, therefore, for a defect of intent, there was no marriage 
in the first place. But as we will see later, this is not Catholic teaching: it's a 
subversion intended to ruin marriage for both parties under the veil of emotional appeal.

The true Catholic teaching on divorce distinguishes between "physical separation" 
and "divorce" (allowing for remarriage):

> We distinguish between "divortium plenum" or perfectum (absolute divorce), which 
> implies the dissolution of the marriage bond, and "divortium imperfectum" (limited divorce), 
> which leaves the marriage bond intact and implies only the cessation of common life 
> (separation from bed and board, or in addition separation of dwelling-place).
>
> -- [Catholic Encyclopedia 1903: Divorce](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05054c.htm)

[Catholic Encyclopedia](https://archive.is/98nZB#selection-339.0-407.32) further 
summarizes very aptly:

- In **Christian marriage** [...] there can **never** be an absolute divorce after consummation
- **Christian marriage before consummation** can be dissolved by solemn profession in a religious order, or by an act of papal authority
- **Divortium imperfectum** is allowed, especially in the case of adultery / heresy
- **Non-Christian marriage** can be dissolved by absolute divorce under certain circumstances (in favour of the Faith)

An argument, often used by Eastern "Orthodox" or Protestants, who allow divorce 
and remarriage is: "But Jesus allows divorce because of infidelity, like Moses did! 
This is a Roman / papal invention!"

However, if we look at the Greek text, we see that "divorce" is a severe mistranslation:

> And I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife ([apolyse: to put away](https://archive.is/wip/ds6A2)), 
> except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he 
> that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.
>
> -- [Matthew 19:9 DRA](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?q=Matthew+19%3A9&x=0&y=0&b=drb&t=0)

The meaning of ἀπολύσῃ (apolyse) here is important, as it easily gets translated into 
"divorce" in the modern sense (divortium perfectum, allowing for remarriage). To prove 
that "apolyse" refers to Mosaic practice of "divortium imperfectum" (separation, but not 
breaking the bond), we simply have to contrast Matthew 19:9 with Luke 16:18:

> Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: 
> and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.
>
> -- [Luke 16:18 DRA](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?q=Luke+16%3A18&x=0&y=0&b=drb)

So, if an "apolyse" refers to a divortium perfectum, as Susan argues, this would "annull" 
the marriage - then how can it be adultery to mary such an "anulled" woman? St. Paul 
distinguishes in 1st Corinthians 7 with his use of "chorizo":

> But if the unbeliever depart (chorizo), let him depart. For a brother or sister is not 
> under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.
>
> -- [1 Corintians 7:15 DRA](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?q=1+Corinthians+7+15&bk=drb)

Paul therefore allows invalidation of the bond (annullment / chorizo) in mixed marriages, 
if the non-Catholic partner wants this. The sprit of the law therefore is simple - one 
may not divorce, as this undermines "what God has put together", but one may "put away", or 
physically separate. 

The justification of both the "Orthodox" and the Protestant therefore hinges on a mere 
appeal to emotion:

> The human marriage experience becomes impossible after the spiritual death of love.
>
> -- [St. John the Evangelist Orthodox Church](https://archive.is/2rpC4#selection-925.2-925.85)

This "Orthodox" definition means that a marriage is not a contract, but an "experience", 
based on a wild misinterpretation of 1st Corintians 7:9: "If they can not control themselves, 
they should marry" - so, the "Orthodox" argue, "if they don't love each other anymore, 
they should divorce".

This was never the traditional teaching, only after the schism of 1054, Patriarch Alexius I 
of Constantinople (1025-1043) [stopped suspending priests for blessing remarriages](https://archive.is/wip/zz3cZ), 
now branding this heretical justification as "traditional Orthodoxy". In addition, in 1086, 
after the schism of 1054, the rejection of the papacy then led to the "Orthodox" accepting 
the secular rules of the Byzantine Empire, which, of course, allowed divorce. 

Both Presbetyrian and Orthodox heretics therefore undermine the sanctity of marriage, 
ignoring the spirit of the law in favor of their own personal feeling. The Latin Canon 
Law is therefore the ONLY one who actually adheres to Jesus' teaching in 
Luke 16:18 and distinguishes between "putting away / physical separation" (divortium 
imperfectum) and "anullment / true divorce" (divortium perfectum).

Modern anullments are completely invalid by any Church standards. However, as we will now 
see, the Church does have a remedy against adulterous spouses.

## Requirements for a valid marriage

The modern obsession with "love" or "mutual submission" as the defining property 
of marriage, leads to an undefinable contract. Before we therefore have to talk 
about marriage, we have to talk about what marriage even is.

Annulments often attack the validity of the marriage itself, based on facts that 
were only know retroactively ("I didn't know he used to be a cheater before, so he 
tricked me into marrying, therefore not full consent"). However, this does not 
invalidate the marriage contract, even if it was made with a deceptive 
person (see "Legitimate Form"). The validity of a marriage, contractually and 
sacramentally, hinges on something far more concrete than fluctuating emotions or 
a subjective sense of union.

> Marriage is made by the consent of the parties, legitimately manifested between 
> persons capable by law; whose consent no human power can supply.
>
> - [Canon 1081 §1 1917 Code of Canon Law](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1081&v=1917)

The validity of a Catholic marriage, which cannot be undone, hinges on three factors:
freedom to marry, full consent and a legitimate form.

### Freedom to Marry

Both individuals must be capable by law of contracting marriage. This means they 
must be free from any "diriment impediments" (Canons 1067-1080 list specific ones):

- Sufficient age ([Can. 1067](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1067&v=1917))
- No prior existing marital bond ([Can. 1069](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1069&v=1917))
- No blood relationship (consanguinity) ([Can. 1076](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1076&v=1917))
- No relationship by marriage affinity ([Can. 1077](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1077&v=1917))
- No sacred orders ([Can. 1072](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1072&v=1917)) or solemn religious vows ([Can. 1073](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1073&v=1917))
- No relation by adoption ([Can. 1092]())

Any one of the above invalidates the marriage contract.

### Full Consent

Both parties must give true, free, and knowing consent. They must at least 
not be ignorant that marriage is a permanent society between a man and a 
woman for the procreation of children:

> §1. For matrimonial consent to be possible, it is necessary that the 
> contracting parties at least not be ignorant that marriage is a permanent 
> partnership between a man and woman for the procreation of children. 
> 
> §2. This ignorance is not presumed after puberty.
>
> -- [Canon 1082](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1082&v=1917)

If someone truly was completely ignorant about these essential properties and 
could somehow prove it, their marriage could potentially be invalid due to 
lack of proper consent. However, the burden of proof would be on them to 
demonstrate this extraordinary ignorance, as the normal presumption is that 
adults understand these basics ("until death do us part" + "children").

This also means that "Josephite marriages" do not exist, in fact there is a 
great delusion about this being a "Catholic tradition". It is not: in 
the eyes of the Church, if a "marriage" positively excludes all right 
to the conjugal act, it is not a valid marriage.

> Spouses have the obligation and the right to maintain their common conjugal 
> life unless a lawful reason excuses them.
>
> -- [Canon 1128, 1917 Code of Canon Law](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1128&v=1917)

Since the Church cannot look into the heart, the intention to consent to the above is 
expressed in the rite and cannot be disputed with internal justification. Once you say 
"I do", it is presumed to be valid, even if in your heart you may intend to cheat later. 
Only if the marriage rite would explicitly express that the "marriage" is only temporary 
(no Catholic rite does), then it would be invalid.

> §1. The internal consent of the mind is always presumed to conform to the words 
> or signs used in the celebration of marriage. 
> 
> §2. But if either or both parties, by a positive act of the will, exclude 
> marriage itself, or all right to the conjugal act, or any essential property 
> of marriage, they contract invalidly.
>
> -- [Canon 1086]()

Later on, we will discuss cases of "I was tricked into marrying him / her", but in 
general: without explicit conditions, mere disappointment does not invalidate a marriage.

### Legitimate Form

For those bound by it, consent must be expressed according to the canonical form 
prescribed by the Church.

> Only those marriages are valid which are contracted before the pastor, or the 
> local Ordinary, or a priest delegated by either, and at least two witnesses.
>
> -- [Canon 1094](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1094&v=1917)

There are however, exceptions to this: Bound by it are all Catholics, but not 
non-Catholics who married earlier and then come to the faith later. Convalidation 
is only necessary if, at the point of the wedding, one partner was a baptized 
Catholic.

For non-Catholics who married civilly, the canonical form does not apply: 
as the Church does recognize "natural marriages", if the above points (full consent, 
freedom to marry, procreation, until death do us part) are respected in the form.
Meaning: a non-Catholic (or a Catholic who was never) who marries outside the 
Church civilly, then converts later, is validly married, even if the rite wasn't 
Catholic.

## Valid marriages cannot be undone

The primary ends of marriage, which defines the marriage **contract**, is merely 
procreation. That's it. However, 

If "love" (often confused with "lust" or romantic feelings or emotional 
fulfillment) or "unity of the spouses" ("you didn't do the dishes enough") 
is the measure, then marriage becomes invalid the moment feelings 
fade - or, according to the modernist writings "Theology of the Body" (JPII) isn't 
being "lived out" to someone's satisfaction. This is a Gnostic redefinition, 
not a Catholic one.

Obviously, marriage can have secondary ends (romance, love, charity), but, as 
we see in ["Is Natural Family Planning Catholic?"](/en/nfp), the very moment that
procreation is not the final end of a marriage, personal enjoyment, lust and 
male-female power dynamics (who wears the pants?) take over and everything falls 
apart: the marriage, the family, the next generation and the society.

It is important to stress that marriage is not a "private" thing: it is public,
because it defines the next generation of a country. Therefore, changes in this
philosophy have massive consequences, such as the current ongoing birth rate 
and divorce crisis: Even among "traditional Catholics", the focus on "natural" 
contraception and "unity of the spouses" distorts the actual definition of marriage,
leading to its downfall.

## Can we invalidate full consent?

Error about the person you're marrying logically invalidates marriage: you did 
intend to marry Steve, but his genetic twin brother Alex showed up at the wedding - 
you are not married to Alex, but also not yet married to Steve. 

Error about a quality of the person does not invalidate the marriage, except if it is a 
lawful condition that was explicitly agreed upon before the wedding and can be proven
to be false (Canon 1092 §4, "Marriage under condition").

> A condition once placed and not revoked:
>
> 1. If it is about the future and is necessary or impossible or immoral,
> but not against the substance of marriage, it is considered as not added (ignored);
>
> 2. If it is about the future and against the substance of marriage, it renders the 
> marriage invalid;
>
> 3. If it is about the future and licit (lawful), it suspends the validity of the marriage;
>
> 4. If it is about the past or present, the marriage will be valid or not, according to 
> whether what is subject to the condition exists or not.
>
> -- [Canon 1092](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1092&v=1917)

Conditions cannot be placed retroactively and have to be explicit and proven to be deceptive. 
To give examples for these cases, that could invalidate a marriage:

- "I marry you on condition that we never have children" (against marriage)
- "I marry you on condition that I can have sexual relationships with others" (violates unity)
- "I marry you on condition that our marriage will end in 5 years" (against marriage)

Additionally, one can marry under a given condition, which has to be explicit, known before 
the marriage, proven to be false and grave enough that one would not have given consent, if known:

- "I marry you if that you have never been married before"
- "I marry you if that you are a citizen of this country"
- "I marry you if that you don't have any debts" (note: has to be explicit and grave debts)
- "I marry you if you are a virgin" (has to explicitly stated and proven for invalidity)

These conditions, especially §4, must be placed on the consent at the point
of the wedding and be grave enough to rise to the level of error about the 
consent or the person (slave, non-citizen). 

For example, for a condition about debt to invalidate marriage, one would need to prove:

- It was an explicit, formal condition
- The other party knew about this condition
- The condition was false (substantial debt, $500 vs. $500.000)
- The deception was grave enough to undermine consent

Generally, the Church requires pre-Cana to make sure these conditions never arise.

Additionally, under §3, a marriage may be suspended under "lawful future conditions", 
such as "I marry you if you convert to Catholicism within one year" - however, 
in this case, the marriage is not invalid, but merely the point at which the 
marriage is valid, is shifted. If the person then doesn't convert within one year, 
this would invalidate the marriage under §4. The Church has been traditionally 
very careful about conditional marriages, as this would create "limbo marriages".

"I didn't know he was a serial cheater" doesn't invalidate the consent given 
on condition, and wasn't expressed as a condition at the point of the wedding. 
While still being an immoral deception, it doesn't invalidate the marriage:

> Even if a marriage was invalidly entered into because of an impediment, 
> the consent given is presumed to persist until its revocation is established.
>
> -- [Canon 1093](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1093&v=1917)

Mere assumption and disappointment do not invalidate the marriage:

> Simple error about marriage's unity, indissolubility, or sacramental 
> dignity doesn't vitiate consent.
>
> -- [Canon 1084](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1084&v=1917)

### Note on "mutual submission"

It is to be noted, that there is no grounds for separation as "no mutual submission"
in Catholic teaching, as men are under no obligation to submit to women:

> Thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.
>
> -- Genesis 3:16

Therefore, any marriage annulled or separated under the pretext of "my husband 
shows no mutual submission" is still valid. The modernist subversion of "mutual 
submission" (mutual charity, loving the spouse as one flesh), causes chaos, but 
this problem seems to be known:

> So many females in these days who endeavor to rule over their husbands, 
> but perhaps the fault is in the men, who do not know how to retain their 
> superiority.
>
> -- St. Robert Bellarmine, 1507

## Separation courts

So, after upholding marriages even with bad people - does the Church want us 
to suffer? Do we have to take slander, abuse and neglect from our spouse and 
just "offer it up to God"? No. To analyze what the bible actually 
says about "is divorce allowed", we have to look at the correct translations.

In Protestant bibles, you will often see Malachi 2:16: "God hates divorce". 
The Douay-Rheims translation reads differently:

> When thou shalt hate her put her away, saith the Lord the God of Israel: but 
> iniquity shall cover his garment, saith the Lord of hosts, keep your spirit, 
> and despise not.
>
> -- [Malachi 2:16 DRA](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=44&ch=2&l=16-#x)

The verse doesn't mention divorce, but to "put her away", i.e. to physically separate.
The "iniquity" covers the garment of the one who separates unjustly or with hate 
(i.e., becoming the guilty party themselves by abandoning a good spouse or not 
seeking reconciliation if the cause ceases).

Remaining with an abusive person is not virtuous; it is "foolish and wicked".

> He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and shall receive a 
> pleasure from the Lord. He that driveth away a good wife, driveth away a good 
> thing: *but he that keepeth an adulteress, is foolish and wicked.*
>
> -- [Proverbs 18:22 DRA](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?q=Proverbs+18%3A22&x=0&y=0&b=drb)

Note that the last part of the verse has been suspiciously dropped from Protestant 
bibles, make sure to select the correct translation.

In Matthew 19:9, Jesus does never allow for remarriage or divorce, he does however
allow to "put her away" (separate) for "fornication": (πορνεία - porneia, a broad term 
for serious sexual misconduct).

Nowhere does Jesus even mention remarriage, disproving both the heretical "Orthodox" 
line of thinking and the modernist-Catholic "annullments". The modern reinterpretation 
that "fornication" means "invalidity" is a novelty designed to justify the annulment explosion.

So, the Church's traditional and still existing (though largely unused) recourse towards
severe marriage problems was not "annulment" and not "divorce": it was physical separation
and, in the worst case, denial of sacraments to the guilty party (i.e. if a man is living 
in public sin with another woman). This was done to uphold the justice of the marriage 
contract, in true charity towards both parties.

> If the other spouse has given his/her name to an un-Catholic sect
> 
> If he/she has educated the offspring un-Catholically
> 
> If he/she leads a criminal and ignominious life; 
> 
> If he/she causes grave danger, either of soul or of body, to the other; 
> 
> If by cruelties he/she renders common life too difficult, 
> 
> ... these and other things of this kind, are for the other spouse legitimate causes 
> for **leaving,** by the authority of the local Ordinary, and also by his/her 
> own authority, if it is certain concerning these things, and there is danger in delay.
>
> -- [Canon 1131 §1, 1917 Code of Canon Law](https://canonlaw.ninja/?nums=1131&v=1917)

"Leaving" here doesn't invalidate the marriage or allow for remarriage, 
as this would be against the command of Jesus. However, it does allow for "separation 
from bread and board" (while the bond remains).

## The Bishops duty

Under normal circumstances, local ordinary (the bishop) has a solemn duty here 
(note: as diocesan bishops are now incredibly modernist, talk to a traditional 
bishop, [see our list](/resistance#bishops)).

> The Christian faithful can legitimately vindicate and defend the rights 
> which they possess in the Church in the competent ecclesiastical forum 
> according to the norm of law.
>
> - Canon 221 §1, 1917 Code of Canon Law

You have a right to have your case heard. A husband (or wife) facing an 
impossible situation due to the other's grave fault should petition the 
tribunal for a separation decree. This initiates a process to determine 
the "lawful reason" and, crucially, identify the guilty and innocent spouse.

This is where the "fair game" is restored. If a wife / husband is found 
to be the guilty party (e.g., through adultery, abuse, abandonment that 
makes common life unduly difficult) and remains "contumacious" (stubbornly 
refusing to amend her ways or reconcile under just terms), the Bishop 
can and should impose penalties. 

Historically, this included denial of the Sacraments. This is the Church's 
"teeth." It tells the wayward spouse: your actions have consequences, not 
just civilly, but ecclesiastically.

The canonical action, while not pleasurable to either party, has to be done, 
in order to uphold justice. Without justice, men (and women) are easily 
dissuaded from modern marriage because "why even bother marrying if
the vow doesn't have any consequences?".

For men / women in this situation, it is advisable to "move first", to preempt 
your partners "divorce/annulment" strategy and places the matter before the 
Church, where it belongs. Confronting the issue canonically is essential.

This process maintains the indissolubility of marriage: It doesn't pretend a 
valid marriage never existed. It acknowledges the tragic reality of grave sin 
within a marriage and provides a just, albeit painful, path forward for the 
innocent spouse and children, while calling the guilty spouse to repentance.

## Goal: Love cannot exist without justice

The current annulment culture is, in many instances, a charade that makes a 
mockery of valid marital vows and Divine Law. It promotes "easy" (though 
emotionally and financially costly) exits that sidestep true culpability.

Catholic husbands faced with a wife (or vice versa) who has "gone off the rails" 
must understand their canonical rights and duties.

1.  **Recognize:** Your wife's actions may constitute grave fault, providing legitimate grounds for separation.
2.  **Reject Myths:** Unless there's clear evidence of invalidity from the outset, your marriage is likely valid.
3.  **Take Action:** Petition your bishop for a separation decree. Insist on your right to an ecclesiastical forum.
4.  **Understand the Goal:** Marriage is not all about love, but also about lawfulness and justice. It is about the salvation of souls (yours, your wife's, your children's), and upholding the sanctity of the sacrament.

Separation from bread and board (while the bond remains) is the Church's painful but just 
provision for unlivable marriages. It is time to bring back the separation courts and 
demand that our shepherds apply true Catholic teaching, not modern, feminized, or emotionally-driven 
substitutes. 

This is how you truly "take your power back" as a Catholic man, "maintain your frame" within 
God's law, and fight for your family and your Faith.
