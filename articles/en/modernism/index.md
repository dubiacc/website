# The Problem of Modernism

The modern world is sliding into madness because of a catastrophic 
philosophical error that has now infected the very heart of the 
Catholic Church. At its core, modernism represents man's prideful 
attempt to replace God with himself, disconnecting the mind from 
objective reality. "Outside my head, God is king - that's His creation. 
But inside my head, I'm king." This poisonous philosophy, which 
began with Immanuel Kant's "Copernican Revolution" in thinking, was 
successfully resisted by the Church throughout the 19th century until 
it finally breached the walls through Vatican II in the 1960s. 

## Kant: Reality is my mind

Modern philosophy has a deadly problem: it has disconnected the mind from
reality. Outside my head, God is king - that's His creation. But inside my
head, I'm king. I can think what I like. I can think that two and two are five.
I can think that water flows uphill. Reality dances to my tune inside my head.
This is the essence of modernism - and it's why the world around us is going
mad. Man transfers reality inside his head to be its master because he wants to
be God, and what he cooks up inside his head bears less and less relation to
reality outside of it.

Modernism is simply the application of this system to the Church. It began with
Immanuel Kant at the end of the 18th century, but it was transferred inside the
Church only at the beginning of the 20th century. For the whole 19th century,
the Church successfully resisted. Pope Pius X recognized the enormous danger 
in his of this seductive system, seductive since dreams are so much nicer than 
reality. Reality is a valley of tears, but in my head, everything can be Disneyland. 
Blessed Pius X, in his 1907 encyclical *Pascendi Dominici Gregis* against modernism,
called it "the synthesis of all heresies."

The heart of modernism lies in its philosophy. Traditionally, the mind accepts
reality as it is. It turns around reality, not the other way around. What does
common sense say? Does my mind turn around the microphone before me, or does
the microphone turn around my mind? Obviously, common sense says my mind turns
around the object. Reality dominates my mind. Reality tells me what it is. I
don't tell reality what it is.

But Immanuel Kant said it's reality that turns around the mind - what he called
the "Copernican Revolution" in philosophy. This completely undermines all
truth. As Pius X wrote, this is like "trying to fit together two and two are
four, and two and two are five." If I say what things are, if I need something
to sit down on, I call it a chair. If I need something to drink, I call the
liquid in my cup coffee rather than poison. But I'm still pretending that it's
my mind making them what they are.

This system is very selective. I apply it when I want to make myself God. I will
not apply it when I want to live and eat and drink and work and drive a car.
It's a system that I apply only when I want to be liberated from anything I
don't like - especially the Church's past and the Commandments of God.

## The True Catholic Faith

Let me illustrate the fundamental difference. For Catholic faith, God is the
center. God reveals the object, and then God gives grace to the subject. The
object is shown by a catechism teacher, by a priest, by a pope. The subject,
under the impulse of grace, believes in the supernatural object revealed by
Almighty God. The object completely dominates the subject.
The subject remains free, still has free will to choose to accept or to refuse,
to submit or not to submit. Nobody believes against his will. The act of faith
is an entirely free act, by which I accept what God puts before me. But I
cannot choose what belongs to Catholic faith - what belongs to it is
objective.

On the other hand, for modernism, the subject is the center. What goes on in his
insides is what controls what he will plaster all over the poor appearances.
Those appearances didn't do anything to deserve this, but they get plastered
with all the falsehoods and idiocies of the modernist believer. God is nowhere.
It's only if I, the subject, accept to plaster the appearances with God that
there's going to be a God. In modernism, God depends entirely on me. In
Catholicism, I depend entirely upon God.

## The Modernist Believer

How does the modernist "believe"? The phenomenist agnosticism of modernism
states the mind cannot know what's beyond the appearances. Philosophy says the
faith is immanent - meaning, it's all inside. The origin of faith is inside.

This is where it really becomes horrible. The appearances of Jesus Christ,
the "Galilean carpenter," make the modernist subject "vibrate." The insides
begin to move, and the subject begins to vibrate in tune with the phenomena.
Here I must use a terrible analogy to express how horrible this doctrine is:
The subject then "vomits" over the appearances the God that he needs, the God
he's creating inside himself. Once he projects upon the phenomena the God he
needs, that comes back to him as "revelation" of the God he needs. And that
becomes his "faith."

In other words, the God I believe in is entirely the production of my own
insides. On the basis of "I know nothing the other side of the phenomena," it
must be something of the phenomena. It's the special "vibrations" of the
Galilean carpenter which made me project my religious sense.

This completely changes the meaning of faith, revelation, dogma - everything!
The same words, the same appearances, but a completely different inside. And
yet these people can think they're good Catholics. It's terribly deceptive.

## Modernism Applied to Dogma

Dogmas, for the modernist, are a living elaboration of the primitive formulae as
the "living community" needs. You start with "Jesus is God" and it evolves
into "*Deum de Deo, Lumen de Lumine*" after 300 years. Now, after 2000 years,
that no longer serves. The 21st century community needs something different.

The sacraments become products of the need for sensible expression of the
religious sense. I need a little host I can eat because that gives me the idea
I'm being fed. It's almost like being given a piece of chocolate! The host
becomes a sense expression that I like.

What then becomes of the Bible? For the modernist, it's merely a collection of
past experiences that are material for the religious sense to relive. The story
of David and Goliath gets people's religious sense going. It's better than a
fourth league team defeating Manchester United! And biblical inspiration? 
It's simply a "vehement stimulus" of the believer to
reveal the faith which is IN him. The original writer of the story of David and
Goliath had such strong vibrations rocking and rolling inside that he had to
express it.

## Faith as an experience

Now what is the Church for modernists? Here's a real "doozy" as Americans would
say: "The church is the vital emanation of the self-promoting collectivity of
consciousnesses." What does that mean? We start with one consciousness, then have
50 "Frankensteins" grouped together all vibrating inside with a certain unity.
The church is the projection from the insides of these 50 rockers and rollers
who are vibrating in unison. This is pure modernism - like charismatics!
They're all rocking and rolling, wanting to make other people join them because
they feel so good together.

What about church authority? For modernists, it must come from consciousness -
from "we the people." Democracy! So the whole church is democratized. The pope
governs with the college of bishops. The bishop governs with a council of
priests. The priest governs with a council of laymen. Authority in the church
is destroyed.

Regarding church and state, modernists say they must be separated because they
have "alien ends," and the state must be "desubordinated." In the old days, the
church and state were united like soul and body. The Catholic Church should be
the soul of the state. But modernists want to separate them, and once they do,
the church loses prestige and the liberals corrupt the state, then use it to
corrupt the church.

For modernists, "In a living religion, everything must move or die." Faith must
progress by the religious sense "perfusing" into the consciousness of each age.
Faith must soak into the mentality of the age and move with it. Therefore,
dogmas must change all the time. This makes all religions in which there is 
a religious sense equally valid. That's why Pope John Paul II went all over the 
world congratulating and fraternizing with masters of other religions. 
He was a "sheer modernist" - and he meant well, I think, but with this 
system, he was off the rails.

This modernism has now infected the church at the highest levels. It began with
Vatican II. Archbishop Lefebvre saw these ideas being accepted by the bishops
and the pope, and sometimes when you listen to his sermons, you can hear the
anguish in his voice at what was happening to the church. What we have today is 
already the result of modernism - the New Mass, ecumenism, democracy in the church, 
the whitewashing of beautiful Catholic churches, the tearing down of high altars. 
They want a Church which is nice and soft and easy, which allows divorce, which 
no longer has Ten Commandments, but only six or five.

They changed the Mass until it's quite different from the old Mass. The New Mass
is man-centered: "Hi, folks. I'm Father James. Call me Jim. Today, we're gonna
celebrate together a Eucharistic picnic. So we're all gonna be happy, happy,
right? Let's give a round of applause to show how happy we're going to be."

## What Can Catholics Do?

What must Catholics do in these times? First, pray the Rosary - I recommend 15
mysteries a day. That's what keeps my head above water. Second, look for the
traditional Mass. Stay away from the New Mass, which is the worship of the
modernist religion.

Be prepared for difficulty. The world has turned into a swirling, dangerous
river. It's very easy to go under and go with the current and stop swimming
against the current. Today it's very easy to lose the faith. The situation is 
desperate, absolutely desperate.

It's a punishment which we have all, more or less, deserved. Saint Paul says, "A
good father who loves his son punishes him." Liberal parents don't punish. They
let the child grow unchecked. But to punish a child, justly and reasonably, is
the sign of love.

If these days weren't shortened, even the elect, if it were possible, will not
be saved. That's what we're facing. Get clear how serious things are today. 
Be prepared for difficulty. The world has turned into a swirling, dangerous river. 
It's very easy to go under and go with the current. But with prayer, vigilance, 
and fidelity to tradition, we can keep our heads above water until God 
intervenes to restore His Church.
