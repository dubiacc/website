# Does Purgatory Exist?

Orthodox Christians often object to the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, claiming 
it has no basis in Scripture or the early Church Fathers. As St. Mark of Ephesus 
argued at the Council of Florence: "If the Orthodox faith does not teach that the 
souls in Purgatory are purified by fire and thereby receive remission of sins, 
then what is the use of prayers for the dead?" Orthodox theology emphasizes God's 
mercy in forgiving the sins of the repentant without requiring punishment after death.

## Refutation

In "Contra Errores Graecorum," St. Thomas Aquinas presents evidence that the 
concept of purification after death was indeed recognized by Eastern Fathers, 
though not always with the precise terminology used in the West, citing St. 
Gregory of Nyssa, who clearly speaks of purification after death:

> Further, Gregory of Nyssa [De iis qui in fide dormiunt] says: "If one who 
> loves and believes in Christ," has failed to wash away his sins in this life, 
> "he is set free after death by the fire of Purgatory." Therefore there 
> remains some kind of cleansing after this life.
> 
> This we preach, holding to the teaching of truth, and this is our belief; 
> this the universal Church holds, by praying for the dead that they may be 
> loosed from sins.

Theodoret of Cyr is also quoted:

> The Apostle states that one is saved thus as through a blazing fire 
> cleansing whatever accumulated through carelessness in life's activity, 
> or at least from the dust of the feet of earthly living. In this fire 
> one remains so long as any earthly and bodily affections are being purged.
>
> -- [source]()

These teachings align with the Catholic understanding of Purgatory as a state 
of purification necessary for souls who die in God's friendship but still bear 
the consequences of sin. This doctrine follows logically from the principles that 
(1) nothing impure can enter heaven (Rev. 21:27) and (2) God's mercy does not 
eliminate the need for the restoration of the disorder caused by sin.

The objection that God simply forgives sins without requiring satisfaction overlooks 
the distinction between the guilt of sin (which is indeed forgiven through repentance) 
and the temporal effects of sin, which may require purification. This distinction is 
evident in Scripture, as when Nathan told David his sin was forgiven but he would 
still suffer consequences (2 Samuel 12:13-14).

## Conclusion

While Orthodox theology emphasizes God's mercy and may express reservations about 
certain Western formulations regarding Purgatory, the fundamental concept of posthumous 
purification for those who die in God's grace but still imperfect has roots in the Eastern 
tradition as well. As Aquinas demonstrates, prayers for the dead—a practice maintained 
by both Catholics and Orthodox—presuppose that the departed may benefit from such 
intercession, implying some process of growth or purification after death.
