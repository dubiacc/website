# Does a heretical pope lose his office?

We live in times of unparalleled confusion and scandalous popes. On the other side 
of the aisle stand those that seem to think we must follow the pope always and 
without questioning (hyperpapalists, see [How much obedience do we owe the Pope?](/en/obedience)) 
or those who seem to think that the errors of Vatican II have to be followed. 

Others fall into the opposite extreme: Sedevacantism, the claim that the Chair of 
Peter is vacant because a Pope could not possibly do or say such things. Both positions 
stem from a misunderstanding of the papacy, its powers, and its limits. 

This site, run with the approval of the SSPX Resistance priests, stands in the middle 
position, which is often overlooked. But as we will see, moderation is a virtue, even 
in theological matters.

## Vatican II promulgated heresies?

**Objection 1:** Vatican II promulgated heresies (e.g., religious liberty, ecumenism) condemned by
previous Popes like Gregory XVI (*Mirari Vos*), Pius IX (*Quanta Cura, Syllabus*),
Leo XIII (*Immortale Dei, Libertas Humana*), and Pius XI (*Mortalium Animos*).

> The Second Vatican Council is to be rejected as a false council because it
> has erred in its teachings on faith and morals.
>
> -- [CMRI]() -- [Theological Position: Sede Vacante]()

**Sed contra:** The documents of Vatican II were, as Paul VI himself stated
in his closing speech (Dec. 7, 1965), primarily pastoral and did not intend to
define new dogmas.

> This synod... has avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner dogmas endowed
> with the note of infallibility.
>
> -- ["Pope Paul VI"]() -- [Closing Speech to Vatican II, Dec. 7, 1965]()

While they contain ambiguities, errors, and statements that contradict previous
magisterial teaching (material heresy), they were not promulgated with the full
force of infallible definitions meant to bind the entire Church under pain of
anathema. Their authority is thus questionable and their problematic teachings can
and must be rejected by comparing them to Tradition.

## The Novus Ordo contradicts Church Teaching?

**Objection 2:** The Novus Ordo Missae, promulgated by Paul VI, represents a "striking departure
from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session XXII of the
Council of Trent" (Cardinal Ottaviani) and is a danger to the Faith.

> [The Novus Ordo Missae] contradicts previous infallible teachings and decrees...
> In all instances a Novus Ordo Missae is a clear danger to one’s faith.
>
> -- [CMRI]() -- [Theological Position: Sede Vacante]()

**Sed contra:** The New Mass is indeed a grave departure. However, Paul VI, while 
promulgating it, was, by the Holy Spirit’s protection, prevented from *absolutely and schismatically* 
abrogating the Traditional Rite and *infallibly* imposing his new creation in a 
way that would make the *Conciliar Church* the *Catholic Church* through this 
liturgical act alone.

> Paul VI never, by his own signature, made this new liturgy obligatory.
> 
> Had Paul VI published a decree stating that the Pope has the right to write a new
> rite at any time, [...] and that from now on every priest [...] must use this Missal,
> then the sedevacantists would probably be right, because then Paul VI would have
> gone into a formal schism.
> 
> The Holy Spirit preserved him from that.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Papalismus, 01:02:04-01:03:45]()

Paul VI was responsible for the disastrous Novus Ordo Missae and the new, arguably
invalid, rite of episcopal consecration (1968). His actions were objectively harmful.
However, as argued above, he was prevented by the Holy Spirit from issuing a
*formally schismatic and infallibly binding decree* that would have definitively
severed his creation from any claim to Catholicity or absolutely mandated it in a way
that destroyed the true Mass with full, unquestionable apostolic authority. He created
a new liturgy, but the documents, like *Missale Romanum* (1969), lack the force to
abrogate *Quo Primum* or to make his new rite *the sole and exclusive rite of the Roman
Church* in a dogmatically binding way.

> In this decree *Missale Romanum*, Paul VI says nowhere that this Mass must now be
> used... Had Paul VI published a decree... stating that the Pope has the right at any
> time to write a new rite... and from now on every priest in the Latin Church must
> use this missal, then the Sedevacantists would probably be right, because then Paul
> VI would have gone into a formal schism.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Papalismus, 01:03:05-01:03:42]()

His actions were those of a Modernist implementing a revolution, but within certain
divinely permitted, though mysterious, limits that prevented an *ex cathedra* definition
of heresy or a complete, formal, and juridically "clean" break that would make the
vacancy of the See undeniable to all.

## The 1983 Canon Law contains sacrilege?

**Objection 3:** The New Code of Canon Law (1983) permits sacrilegious administration of sacraments
to non-Catholics, contrary to Canon 731 (1917 Code) and the Council of Florence.

**Sed contra:** Universal disciplinary laws are protected by infallibility from 
commanding something sinful or directly harmful to the Faith
*when peacefully and universally accepted by the Church as legitimate*. 

The 1983 Code, promulgated by John Paul II, contains problematic canons (like that on
*communicatio in sacris*). However, its problematic nature stems from the
heretical mindset of Vatican II it seeks to implement. It being problematic
reinforces the issue with its promulgator, but the Code itself is a disciplinary
matter that a true Pope *could* change, unlike dogma. A true Pope cannot bind his
successors in merely disciplinary matters.

## Paul IV: no heretic can be pope?

**Objection 4:** Pope Paul IV, in his Bull *Cum ex apostolatus officio* (1559), decreed:

> If ever at any time it appears that… the Roman Pontiff has deviated from the
> Catholic Faith or fallen into some heresy before assuming the papacy, the
> assumption... stands null, invalid and void... and let such ones by that very
> fact (eo ipso) and without any declaration required be deprived of all dignity,
> place, honor, title, authority, office, and power.
>
> -- [Pope Paul IV, Cum ex apostolatus officio (1559)]() -- [as cited by CMRI]()

**Sed contra:** This Bull of Pope Paul IV was a disciplinary  measure for its time.

> The papal bull *Cum ex Apostolatus Officio* was a document that was basically
> no authority. It wasn't dogmatic at all... The next pope who wrote about
> the laws of how to elect a pope didn't even mention *Cum ex Apostolatus Officio*.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Paul IV's bull and sedevacantism, 00:02:14-00:02:35]()

Papal electoral law has been changed many times. Pius X, Pius XII, Paul VI, and John
Paul II all issued new conclave regulations, superseding previous ones. Furthermore, 
Leo XIII implicitly contradicted Paul IV by making the *former heretic* John Henry 
Newman a Cardinal, eligible for the papacy.

## The 1917 Canon Law says no heretic can be pope

**Objection 5:** Canon 188, n. 4 of the 1917 Code states that offices become vacant *ipso facto* by
public defection from the Catholic Faith.

**Sed contra:** This canon refers to *tacit resignation* from office
due to *public defection* from the Faith. "Public defection" in canon law
traditionally means notorious apostasy (e.g., joining another religion) or becoming
a public schismatic. 

While teaching heresy is a crime against the Faith, it is distinct from the specific 
canonical crime of "public defection" that triggers *ipso facto* loss of office under 
this canon without any declaration. For a Pope, the matter is more complex, as there 
is no superior to declare his defection.

## Bellarmine teaches no manifest heretic can be pope?

**Objection 6:** St. Robert Bellarmine teaches that "a pope who is a manifest 
heretic by that fact (*per se*) ceases to be pope and head."

> This is the judgment of all the early Fathers, who teach that manifest heretics
> immediately lose all jurisdiction.
>
> -- [St. Robert Bellarmine, De Romano Pontifice, Ch. XXX]() -- [as cited by CMRI]()

**Sed contra:** Bellarmine presents five opinions on how a heretical Pope might lose 
office. The 5th opinion (that a *manifest* heretic *ipso facto* ceases to be Pope) is 
the one he favored. However, "manifest" implies something notorious and widely recognized. 

Theologians dispute whether this loss of office is immediate before any declaration by the 
Church (even if only a declarative one acknowledging the fact), or if such a declaration 
is necessary for the Church to act with juridical certainty. The very crisis is that 
those who *could* make such a declaration are themselves part of the problem.

## Lefebvre - a sedevacantist?

**Objection 7:** Archbishop Lefebvre stated in 1976:

> This Conciliar Church is schismatic... heretical. This Conciliar Church is,
> therefore, not Catholic. To whatever extent Pope, bishops, priests or faithful
> adhere to this new Church, they separate themselves from the Catholic Church.
>
> -- [Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]() -- [June 29, 1976 Reflection, as cited by CMRI]()

Therefore, those who promulgate such things cannot be true Popes, and the See of Peter
is vacant.

**Sed contra:** A *material heretic* utters a statement objectively contrary to defined dogma. 
A *formal heretic* does so with pertinacity (stubbornness) and full awareness of contradicting 
the Church's binding teaching. Only formal, manifest, and notorious heresy would lead to loss of office.

> So long as a Pope proclaims errors... one cannot prove the sin of heresy against
> him... I cannot prove that he wants to say something other than the teaching of
> the Church. And the current Pope [JPII] certainly does not do that. He always emphasizes
> that one must hold fast to the teaching of the Church. 
> 
> Only because his concept of Tradition is completely false does he believe that 
> he can proclaim things here that... place him in, as he would say, 
> "apparent contradiction to what is the Faith of the Church."
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Papalismus, 01:27:01-01:28:02]()

The "popes" of Vatican II often present their novelties under the guise of
"development" or pastoral adaptation, not as direct, formal contradiction of past
dogmas which they *acknowledge as dogmas*. This creates confusion but falls short
of the "manifest" and "pertinacious" rejection required for automatic loss of office
in the eyes of the universal Church.

> If a pope says: "The Council of Trent says... buy I say something else", then he 
> would be a formal heretic, because he knowingly goes against an infallible council. 
> But this is not what the modernists say.
>
> The pope says "The Council of Trent says... 

As Archbishop Lefebvre so profoundly explained, likening the current crisis to the
Passion of Christ:

> Just as then, so many faithful did not cope with the suffering of Christ and said:
> "Someone who suffered so cannot be God." ... And so, Archbishop Lefebvre said, the
> faithful today do not cope with the suffering of Christ. They cannot understand it.
> They cannot accept that the Mystical Body of Christ... the Catholic Church, is today
> subjected to such a terrible suffering, and they therefore deny either the human
> side of the Church... by overemphasizing the divinity of the Pope and saying the Pope
> cannot err... Or they come, the Sedevacantists, and they overemphasize now the human
> side, by saying: "Someone who errs cannot be Pope."
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse, citing Archbishop Lefebvre]() -- [Papalismus, 01:34:00-01:36:53]()

The Church is both divine and human. Her divine side is indefectible. Her human
members, even Popes, can fail. We are in a Passion. We must adhere to what the Church
*has always taught*, resist novelty, pray for the Pope's conversion or for a true
successor, but not rush to declare the See vacant based on private judgment when the
Church herself has not provided a clear, canonical path for such a declaration regarding
a reigning Pontiff. The limits of papal power are clear; our duty is to the Faith, first
and always. This is the path of true obedience and fidelity.

## Heresy, and yet they remained true popes

### St. Peter

St. Peter himself erred in conduct at Antioch and was publicly rebuked by St. Paul 
(Gal 2:11-14). He did not cease to be Pope.

### Pope Liberius

Pope Liberius (352-366) signed a semi-Arian creed and excommunicated St.
Athanasius. St. Hilary called him a "traitor." Yet, he is listed as Pope.

### Pope Honorius I

Pope Honorius I (625-638) was posthumously anathematized by the Third Council of
Constantinople for Monothelitism. No one claimed the See was vacant during his reign
or that his acts were universally null from the start.

### Pope Nicholas I

**Pope Nicholas I** (858-867) erred in teaching that baptism in Christ’s name alone
was valid, against defined Trinitarian formula.

### Pope John XXII

Pope John XXII (1316-1334) taught that the souls of the just do not see God
until after the Last Judgment. He was widely opposed and recanted on his deathbed.
His successor, Benedict XII, defined the correct doctrine.
> This was against a *sententia communis* (commonly held teaching) but not yet
> dogma. The Cardinals and theologians told him: "Holy Father, with all due
> respect, that is not possible. That is not what you are saying. The Church has
> never believed that; the Church has always believed something else." He was
> stubborn, but thank God, he recanted.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Papalismus, 00:43:20-00:45:19]()

### Pope Pius IX

Pope Pius IX (1846-1878), in the very Bull *Ineffabilis Deus* defining the
Immaculate Conception, erred in the *sanction*:

> Should any, which God forbid, presume to think in their hearts otherwise than has
> been defined by Us, let them know and understand that they are condemned by their
> own judgment; that they have suffered shipwreck in the faith; and have
> defected from the unity of the Church.
>
> -- [Pope Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus (1854)]() -- []()

This contradicts the Church’s teaching *de occultis ecclesia non judicat* (the
Church does not judge hidden things). Yet, his definition of the dogma was
infallible.

> This was an error, as the Church does not judge internal thoughts. It was a
> teaching error in the decree of a dogma, 16 years *before* the definition of
> papal infallibility! The humor of God!
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [Fallibilitas Papae, 01:06:28-01:08:20]()

## Playing devils advocate

Church history shows Popes who personally erred or were even accused
of heresy yet were never considered to have lost their office automatically without
some form of judgment or universal recognition by the Church. Pius IX, in response to
Bishop Gasser of Brixen's query *before the definition of infallibility*, stated:

> If a future pope proclaims heresy, then you simply don't follow him.
>
> -- [Pope Pius IX to Bishop Gasser]() -- [Mansi, 52, 1212-1214]()

He did not say, "then he is no longer Pope." Furthermore, St. Robert Bellarmine, while
presenting the "5th opinion" (that a manifest heretic Pope *ipso facto* loses office)
as "true," also discussed the other four opinions without definitively resolving the
practical mechanism for the Church. The key is "manifest" and "pertinacious".

A Pope can indeed err in his non-infallible teachings or personal opinions, or even 
sin gravely, without *automatically* and *secretly* ceasing to be Pope in such a way 
that the entire Church is unknowingly following an anti-pope.

The sedevacantist position, while understandably reacting to grave errors, therefore
simplifies complex theological and canonical realities. Ultimately the position is,
that we cannot espouse positions and theories without dogmatic certainty.

## The First See is judged by no one

While theologians like Bellarmine and Suarez discussed mechanisms like an imperfect 
general council declaring the *fact* of a Pope's heresy, no such mechanism has ever 
been successfully invoked (see: cadaver synod) or is clearly established in law for 
such an eventuality. This juridical impasse is part of the crisis.

## Sedevacantism: An obstacle to salvation?

## Conclusion

We ask our readers: do not fall into the abyss of Papolatry on one side, nor into 
the chasm of private judgment declaring the See vacant on the other. Hold fast to 
Tradition. The Church of Christ will endure, for the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
