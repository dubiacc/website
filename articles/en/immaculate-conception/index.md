# A defense of the Immaculate Conception

Orthodox Christians typically object to the Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which teaches 
that Mary was preserved from original sin from the moment of her conception. St. John Maximovitch 
articulated a common Orthodox critique: "This teaching, which seemingly highly exalted the Virgin
Mary, but in reality denied all her virtues" by removing her moral struggle and free will. Orthodox 
theology maintains Mary was born with a fallen nature like all humans but remained sinless 
through her cooperation with divine grace.

## Refutation

While "Contra Errores Graecorum" predates the formal definition of the Immaculate Conception (1854), St. Thomas Aquinas addresses the theological foundations of Mary's sinlessness that support this doctrine. He draws on Eastern Fathers who emphasized Mary's exceptional holiness and purity.

> "Jesus...was free from original sin in his conception, and his Virgin Mother was free from original sin in her birth." 

Aquinas cites St. John Damascene, who writes:

> "On thee, as on ground unplowed, fell the heavenly rain, Christ. Hail, thou who before thy marriage didst miraculously conceive the ear untouched by man. Hail, thou unspotted, undefiled and most pure Mother of God."

From St. Germanus of Constantinople:

> "As the pearl is formed undefiled in the injured oyster, so also is Christ formed in the undefiled Womb of His Mother without sin."

Aquinas explains that Mary's preservation from sin was fitting for three reasons. First, because of her unique relationship to Christ: as the Mother of God, she was to provide the physical substance from which Christ's body would be formed, and it was fitting that this substance be completely pure. Second, for her own dignity: as the new Eve, Mary needed the fullness of grace to overcome the power of sin that affected all humanity. Third, for our salvation: God desired to prepare a worthy dwelling place for His Son.

The Orthodox concern about Mary's moral struggle is addressed by clarifying that the Immaculate Conception did not deprive Mary of free will or the possibility of merit. Rather, she was preserved by a special application of Christ's redemptive grace. Mary still needed Christ as her Savior, but she was saved in a more perfect wayâ€”by prevention rather than by healing after contracting sin. This unique preservation made her all the more grateful to God and engaged in a life of virtue.

As for the claim that Mary needed to share our fallen nature to transmit humanity to Christ, Aquinas would distinguish between fallen nature itself (which includes mortality and suffering) and the stain of original sin (which is the privation of original justice). Mary could transmit human nature to Christ without transmitting the stain of sin.

## Conclusion

The Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, as rooted in the teachings examined by Aquinas, does not diminish Mary's virtues but rather recognizes the perfect work of grace in her from the beginning of her existence. Far from removing her free cooperation with God, it acknowledges that her "fiat" was given from a heart uniquely prepared by God's grace. The Eastern Fathers' emphasis on Mary's exceptional purity provides a foundation for this understanding, even if they did not articulate the doctrine with the precision of later theological development.
