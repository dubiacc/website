# Learn Church Latin

This free course offers a simple way to learn ecclesiastical Latin. 
The course is split into vocabulary tests (V01 - V03) and grammar tests (G1 - G11).

Starting off, you'll memorize the 1000 most common Latin words. You can now already read 
most prayers in the Divine Office, but you won't truly understand the syntax or how 
to form your own sentences.

In the beginner lessons (G01 - G05), you will learn fundamental noun cases and declensions, 
verb conjugations in present, imperfect, and future tenses, and basic sentence structures. 

In the intermediate lessons (G02 - G06), you will master perfect and pluperfect tenses, active 
and passive voice, participles, ablative absolutes, and subjunctive clauses. At this point, you 
can already read excerpts from Cicero and basic Church texts.

In the advanced lessons (G07 - G11), you will work with indirect speech, conditional sentences, 
gerundives, and passive periphrastic constructions. At this point, you can engage with writings from 
St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas.

After that, it's back to two more vocabulary lessons to finish the course, so you'll have learned
about 5.000 of the 40.000 existing Latin words.
