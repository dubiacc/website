Do statues resemble pagan idols? The Seventh Ecumenical Council approved various art forms based on principle, not dimension: Honor shown to sacred images passes to the thing they resemble.

# May Christians Venerate Statues?

While both Orthodox and Catholics venerate religious images, Orthodox Christians 
criticize Catholic use of three-dimensional statues as opposed to two-dimensional 
icons. They argue that statues too closely resemble pagan idols and cite the 
decisions of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, which approved icons but did not 
explicitly mention statues. Orthodox tradition holds that icons, with their 
distinctive style that emphasizes the transfigured spiritual reality rather than 
naturalistic representation, provide a proper "window to heaven".

## Refutation

In "Contra Errores Graecorum," St. Thomas Aquinas addresses questions about sacred art 
by examining how both traditions understand religious images as aids to devotion rather 
than objects of worship in themselves.

> The august Ecumenical Councils, those seven pillars of the house of Wisdom, were 
> organized in it and among us. This, our Church, holds the originals of their sacred 
> definitions.

Aquinas acknowledges the importance of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea II, 787), 
which defined the proper veneration of sacred images against the iconoclasts. He points 
out that this Council approved various forms of religious art:

> The definition given by the Seventh Ecumenical Council was that images be produced with 
> paints (or colors), with mosaic, or tesselated, and with any other suitable material, 
> such as gold and silver and other metals... The images may be inscribed upon sacred 
> utensils, divine Gospels, precious Crosses, robes, sheets, cloths, walls, boards and houses.
> 

Thomas notes that the Council's primary concern was not the artistic medium or dimensionality 
of images but rather the theological principle that honor shown to sacred images passes to 
their prototypes. The distinction between veneration (proskynesis) and worship (latreia) 
is what separates Christian practice from idolatry.

Aquinas would point out that the development of different artistic styles in East and 
West reflects cultural adaptations rather than theological differences. The Byzantine 
iconographic style developed in particular historical circumstances, just as Western 
religious art evolved in dialogue with changing artistic movements.

The essential principle maintained by both traditions is that sacred images serve to 
raise the mind and heart to God and the saints they represent. As the Seventh Council 
declared, "The honor paid to the image passes to its prototype, and whoever venerates an 
image venerates the person depicted in it."

## Conclusion

While acknowledging the distinctive artistic traditions that developed in East and West, 
Aquinas would emphasize that both Catholic and Orthodox understandings of sacred images 
rest on the same theological foundation established by the Seventh Ecumenical Council. 
The difference in artistic expression between icons and statues does not constitute a 
theological error but rather represents cultural and aesthetic diversity within the 
universal Church. What matters most is not the artistic medium but the theological 
understanding that sacred images facilitate, rather than obstruct, our worship of God 
and communion with the saints.
