Luther was condemned because during the Leipzig Disputation he questioned papal primacy, 
declared church councils could err, expressed sympathy for Jan Hus's teachings that had 
been declared heretical, and elevated scripture above church tradition. This article analyzes
his arguments in detail.

# Why was Luther condemned?

The Leipzig Disputation was a pivotal academic debate between the Ingolstadt theology professor 
Johannes Eck and the Wittenberg theologians Andreas Bodenstein (called Karlstadt) and Martin 
Luther. This significant event in early Reformation history took place from June 27 to July 15, 1519, 
in the Pleißenburg castle in Leipzig, with Duke George of Saxony successfully advocating for 
the University of Leipzig to host the debate.

## Historical Background

This short summary (section "Historical Context") was taken from the 
[German Wikipedia page "Leizpizger Disputation"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipziger_Disputation),
summarized, translated and shortened, in order to set the 
context of the actual debate.

### Historical Context

The Leipzig Disputation occurred during a critical window in 1519-1520. After Emperor Maximilian 
died on January 12, 1519, Luther's prince, Frederick the Wise of Saxony, played an important role 
in the upcoming imperial election as a member of the Electoral College. Frederick protected his 
Wittenberg professor when Luther got into conflict with the Roman Curia over his 95 Theses. The 
Curia, primarily interested in Frederick supporting their preferred candidate in the imperial election, 
temporarily suspended Luther's heresy trial to avoid offending Frederick. This allowed Luther and 
his circle to spread their "reform ideas" unhindered for a year.

Parallel to the Leipzig Disputation, the imperial election took place in Frankfurt. The Habsburg 
candidate Charles was elected on June 28, 1519, and signed the electoral capitulation drafted by 
Frederick the Wise on July 3.

### Timeline of Events

#### Early Correspondence
Before their disputes, Johannes Eck and Martin Luther maintained a friendly correspondence, 
facilitated by the Nuremberg diplomat and humanist Christoph Scheurl. This was not a personal 
relationship but a typical scholarly contact among humanists who shared works and maintained 
written communication.

#### The "Obelisci"
During a visit with the Prince-Bishop of Eichstätt, Eck criticized Luther's theses. The bishop 
requested a written critique, so Eck wrote annotations (Adnotationes) on eighteen of Luther's 95 
Theses intended for the bishop's personal use. The Augsburg canon Bernhard Adelmann secretly 
forwarded this text to Luther, who titled it "Obelisci" ("little spears"). In medieval scholarship, 
the obeliscus was a mark used to identify heretical statements.

#### Luther's "Asterisci"
Luther wrote a counter-document titled "Asterisci" ("little stars"), which he sent to Eck via Wenzeslaus 
Linck on May 19. In his accompanying letter, Luther expressed hurt over Eck's sharp tone. Neither the 
Obelisci nor the Asterisci were intended for publication.

#### Karlstadt's Challenge
Meanwhile, Karlstadt, the Dean of the Theological Faculty at Wittenberg University, had read the Obelisci. 
Without Luther's knowledge, he published 406 theses, with theses 103-213 directed against Eck. He aimed to 
defend the university's reputation. These "Defensive Conclusions" (Apologeticae conclusiones) also 
represented Karlstadt's personal theological position, emphasizing the Bible as the highest authority and 
man's passivity toward God's grace.

#### Eck's Response
Eck published a defense titled "Defense against the bitter attacks of Dr. Andreas Bodenstein of Karlstadt." 
On the title page, he proposed settling the disputed questions through the Apostolic See and the Universities 
of Rome, Paris, or Cologne. He suggested April 3, 1519, for the disputation, with Karlstadt choosing the location.

#### Preliminary Negotiations
Luther and Eck met at the Diet of Augsburg and agreed on the conditions for the disputation. Luther acted as 
negotiator for Karlstadt. The Wittenbergers suggested Leipzig or Erfurt, and Eck chose Leipzig.

#### Duke George's Involvement
Eck approached the University of Leipzig through Duke George of Saxony. Initially, Leipzig theologians resisted, 
suggesting the delicate topic should be handled at a provincial synod or before papal commissioners. Bishop Adolf 
of Merseburg also appealed to the Duke to cancel the event. However, Duke George personally wanted the 
disputation to take place to enhance his state university's prestige.

#### Karlstadt's Provocative Flyer
To prepare for the Leipzig Disputation, Karlstadt collaborated with Lucas Cranach the Elder to create a large 
flyer titled "Wagen" (Wagon). It showed an eight-horse carriage driven by Paul and Augustine carrying a layman 
to heaven's gate where Christ awaited, contrasted with a seven-horse carriage carrying a scholastic theologian 
in the opposite direction toward hell. This was likely the earliest Reformation flyer and proved highly provocative.

#### Eck's Theses
Eck published twelve theses as the textual basis for his disputation with Karlstadt. However, he incorporated topics 
from Luther's 95 Theses, particularly in his final thesis which referenced Luther's commentary on his 95 Theses 
(the Resolutiones). Against Luther, Eck formulated: "It is false to claim that the Roman Church before the time of 
[Pope] Sylvester did not have supremacy; rather, we have always recognized the one who occupied St. Peter's seat and 
possessed his faith as Peter's successor and Christ's universal vicar." This put the topic of papal primacy on the agenda.

#### Luther's Counter-Theses

Though not scheduled as a disputant, Luther responded with 12 counter-theses that he attached to an open letter to 
Karlstadt, which were printed on February 7.

#### Eck's Expanded Theses

Eck published "Disputation and Excuse of Johannes Eck against the Accusations of Brother Martin Luther of the 
Order of Hermits," expanding his series of theses. The conclusion regarding Roman Church superiority became 
Eck's thirteenth thesis.

#### Luther's Preparation
Luther engaged in thorough studies of church law and history to prepare, resulting in the publication "Luther's 
Explanation of his 13th Thesis on the Power of the Pope." In this work, Luther valued the councils of the early 
church and the Church Fathers as they were relatively close to the New Testament in time and content, while 
critically evaluating later church tradition and its councils.

## The Leipzig Debate

Following is a summarized list of arguments and counter-arguments of the debate, translated from the German / Latin source text.

### Free Will Debate

#### Initial Argument

The human will possesses active causality (causalitatem activam, vim productivam, elicitivam) in producing 
meritorious works, although always aided by God's grace and special help ("non excludendo gratiam et speciale 
adiutorium dei"). To deny this active role is Manichaean heresy.

##### Primary Evidence

Sirach 15:14-18: "Deus ab initio constituit hominem et reliquit illum in manu consilii sui... apposuit tibi aquam 
et ignem, ad quod volueris, porrige manum tuam. Ante hominem vita et mors, bonum et malum, quod placuerit ei, dabitur 
ei". Eck argues this applies to humanity after the fall ("ad homines tum praesentes et posteros"), not just Adam before 
the fall, citing Jerome's application to contemporary people.

##### Supporting Fathers
Cites Bernard saying Adam retained free will ("libertatem Adam tam post peccatum quam ante semper tenuit inconcussum") 
and Jerome stating we have the power to sin or not sin, within human limits ("in nostra esse positum potestate vel 
peccare vel non peccare... Sed hoc pro modo et tempore et conditione humanae fragilitatis"). Free will is wounded 
("vulneratum" - Ambrose) or limping ("claudicans" - Augustine), but not destroyed.

#### Response

##### Sirach 15

This text refers to Adam before the fall or humanity as originally created ("loquitur de primo homine et de toto humano 
genere"). Had Adam stood, righteousness would have been given to all. After the fall, man is captive to sin ("factus est serpenti i. e. diabolo... captivus").

##### Role of Grace

Grace is the active agent that moves the hand ("Gratia enim agit manum et extendit"). Cites Rom 8 ("qui sunt filii dei, 
aguntur spiritu sancto") and 1 John 3 ("Omnis, qui facit iustitiam, ex deo natus est").

##### Interpretation of Fathers

Bernard's quote discusses freedom *of volition*, not freedom *from sin* ("loquitur de libertate in volitionibus"). 
Cites Bernard elsewhere: Man fell from "posse non peccare" to "non posse non peccare". Augustine applies Sirach 15 
to Adam's *initial* grace. Jerome would never suggest fallen man can avoid sin without grace. Ambrose (De voc. gent.) 
states free will without grace is unstable and cannot produce works acceptable to God ("liberum arbitrium absque 
gratia... nihil ex se ipsa facere potest, quod deo acceptum est"). Cites the hymn: "sine tuo numine nihil est in 
homine, nihil est innoxium".

#### Rebuttal

##### Purpose of Sirach 15

If it speaks through Adam to all humanity, it still describes the *nature* of our free will. The admonition "si 
volueris" is directed to the living.

##### Core Point (Clarification)

Eck doesn't deny the *necessity* of grace (avoiding Pelagianism). The issue is whether free will, *aided by grace*, 
retains an *active* capacity ("vim productivam elicitivam") or is purely passive ("mere passive ad bonum") and 
merely nominal ("res de solo titulo post peccatum"). It *cooperates* ("cooperaretur deo sua gratia adiuvante").

##### Parable of Talents

The servant claims *he* gained the talents ("ecce alia quinque superlucratus sum"). If purely passive, he would 
have reported *receiving* ten. This shows cooperation.

##### Use of Fathers

Augustine/Ambrose cited only to show free will *remained* post-fall, albeit weakened. Eck agrees it needs 
grace for acceptable works.

#### Counter-Rebuttal

##### Eck's Point Not Proven

Eck fails to prove a *special, natural* activity distinct from grace ("specialem quandam activitatem et 
naturalem a gratia distinctam").

##### Parable of Talents Reinterpreted

The servant's words should be understood like Paul's in 1 Cor 15:10: "Non ego lucratus sum, sed gratia 
dei mecum". Ambiguous texts must yield to clear ones.

##### Nature of Free Will

True freedom ("veram libertatem") comes from Christ alone. Good works are entirely God's in terms 
of activity ("tota esse dei... quantum ad activitatem"), becoming ours only by bestowal ("nostra fieri per 
collationem gratiae divinae").

#### Subsequent Key Arguments

- **Eck**: Interprets "gratia dei mecum" (1 Cor 15:10) using Jerome and Bernard: it implies cooperation ("utriusque operatio"). Jerome: Neither grace without Paul nor Paul without grace, preserving free will. Bernard: Paul presents himself as a *partner* ("socium per consensum") with grace. Bernard states grace and free will are *one total cause* ("unam esse causam totalem"), working together ("mixtim non singillatim, simul non vicissim").

- **Karlstadt**: Cites Augustine on Sirach 15: God prepares the will, we must ask Him to make us willing. Warns Eck against pride. Cites 2 Cor 4:7 ("habemus thesaurum istum in vasis fictilibus... ut sublimitas sit virtutis dei et non ex nobis"). Emphasizes John 3:27 ("Non potest homo accipere quicquam, nisi... datum de coelo"). Cites Ambrose (De voc. gent.): Grace prepares the will as a *recipient* and *servant* ("receptricem et famulam"). Cites Bernard: "Deus auctor est salutis, liberum arbitrium tantum capax" - "tantum" excludes activity. The "partnership" is merely the will's grace-inspired *consent*.

- **Eck** Repeats Augustine comparing grace to a rider, free will to a horse (Hypognosticon 3). Consent *is* an operation of free will. Cites Augustine (Tract. in Ep. Joh.): "quia agis ibi aliquid voluntate, ideo tibi aliquid tributum est". Claims Augustine defended free will against Julian.

- **Karlstadt**: Denies free will has *special and natural* activity in good works, only activity given by grace. Rejects Eck's interpretation of Augustine's horse analogy.

- **Eck**: Accuses Karlstadt of changing position, claiming Karlstadt now admits activity *communicated* by grace ("nunquam se negasse activitatem liberi arbitrii a gratia sibi communicatam"). Cites Karlstadt's and Luther's earlier writings suggesting pure passivity ("res de solo titulo", "potentia subiectiva"). If Karlstadt agrees they work "simul et mixtim", debate can end.

- **Karlstadt**: Reasserts distinction: denies *natural* activity, accepts *conferred* activity. Free will acts *because it is acted upon* ("liberum arbitrium agit, quia agitur").

- **Eck**: Clarifies his position: Free will has *supernatural* activity communicated by grace ("non naturalem, sed supernaturalem... activitatem a gratia sibi communicatam"). Activity received from another is still *proper* to the recipient. Cites (Pseudo-)Jerome: God made the capacity for good/evil *proper* to man ("proprium fecit eius esse, quod velit"). Final stance: free will has *proper and special* activity, *but such as God and grace give*.

- **Karlstadt**: Asks how two causes (grace, free will) can *each* produce the *whole* work ("utraque totum producit... singula peragunt totum"), unless one is active, the other passive?

- **Eck**: Philosophical explanation: Concurrent causes each produce the whole effect, acting *together* (mixtim, simul), not partially. God is the ultimate first cause.

- **Karlstadt**: Is the good work *effectively all* from God ("totum a deo effective") or not?

- **Eck**: Yes, effectively all from God, but *not totally* ("non totaliter") because free will cooperates. Cites Chrysostom. Bernard agrees: they act *together*.

- **Karlstadt**_ Rejects "non totaliter". Proves work is *all* from God using collects, Augustine (De bono pers. c. 13: "ut detur totum deo"), Cyprian (Christ fights *in us*), 1 Chron 29:14 ("Tua sunt omnia..."), Jerome. Attacks Eck's reliance on Pseudo-Jerome and scholastic distinctions (Capreolus, Scotus).

- **Eck**: Defends scholastics (Aquinas, Bonaventure etc.) as upholding necessity of grace. Cites Augustine (De eccl. dog.) on stages: 1. God gives initiative; 2. Consenting is *ours* ("nostrae potestatis est"); 3. Achieving is God's gift. Bernard's "tantum capax" applies to stage 3 (receiving salvation). Defends (Pseudo-)Jerome. Accuses Karlstadt of misinterpreting Bernard. Repeats challenge: prove pure passivity. Uses Isaiah 10:15 (axe boasting) analogy against Karlstadt: free will is an *animate* instrument, different from inanimate tools. Cites Ezek 36 ("Ego faciam... ut... operemini") as God working *through* us. Asks Karlstadt to explain the role of a pedagogue's stick (instrumentality).

- **Karlstadt**: Uses Isaiah 10:15 to argue that just as tools cannot boast, free will acted upon by grace cannot claim anything for itself ("non potest sibi quicquam arrogare"). The action it performs is God's gift ("munus dei et opus dei"). Rejects Eck's distinction "totum... non totaliter" as an unscriptural "histricosa chimaera".

### Papal Primacy Debate

#### Initial Argument

The monarchy and primacy of one ruler in the Church Militant is *by divine right* and instituted 
by Christ ("Monarchia et unus principatus in ecclesia dei est de iure divino et a Christo institutus").

##### Arguments

1. Church Militant mirrors Church Triumphant, which has a divine monarchy. (Cites John 5:19, Dionysius, Greg. Naz.). A headless church is monstrous (Cyprian).
2. If there's a divinely instituted monarchy, the monarch must be the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor.
3. Cites Cyprian (Ep. 3 ad Corn.): Rome is Peter's chair ("ad Petri cathedram"), the principal church ("ecclesiam principalem"), source of priestly unity ("unde sacerdotalis unitas exorta est"), where faithlessness has no access ("ad quos perfidia habere non possit accessum").
4. Cites Jerome (adv. Lucif.): Church safety depends on high priest's dignity ("ecclesiae salus... in summi sacerdotis dignitate pendet"); necessary to prevent schisms ("tot in ecclesiis efficientur schismata, quot sacerdotes").
5. Cites Jerome (ad Damasum): Associates himself with Peter's chair ("cathedrae Petri consocior"), knows the Church is founded on that rock ("super illam petram fundatam ecclesiam scio"), whoever doesn't gather with Pope scatters.

#### Response

##### Head of the Church

Agrees Church Militant has a head/monarch: *Christ himself* ("eiusque caput non hominem sed Christum ipsum idque auctoritate divina"). (Cites 1 Cor 15:25, Matt 28:20, Acts 9:4 with Augustine's interpretation).

##### Rebuttal of Proofs

1. Eph 4:15 (Christ the head) speaks of the *militant* church, supporting Luther. 1 Cor 3:5 / 1:13 ("Quid est... Cephas?") *prohibits* any other head. John 5:19 is about Christ's equality with Father, not church structure. Dionysius/Greg. Naz. irrelevant to the *head* of the monarchy.
2. Headless Church: If Pope dies, is church headless? Christ is the perpetual head.
3. Cyprian (adv. haer.): Refers to *any* bishop's authority being undermined, not specifically Rome. Cyprian called Pope Cornelius "brother". Cyprian describes *local* election/confirmation (plebs, neighboring bishops), citing Nicea. Cites Cyprian (via Aug. De bapt.): No bishop should make himself "bishop of bishops" ("episcopum se esse episcoporum constituit").
4. Cyprian (unitas exorta): Admits this for the *Western* church ("quantum pertinet ad ecclesiam occidentalem"), but Jerusalem is the true mother church ("proprio matrix"). Origin doesn't equal headship.
5. Jerome (adv. Lucif.): "Detur potestas" implies *human right/consent*, not divine. Greek church never consented. Cites Jerome (ad Euag./Dist. XCIII): Bishops of Rome, Gubbio, etc. have *same merit and priesthood* ("eiusdem meriti et eiusdem sacerdotii"). Jerome (ad Titum): Bishop/presbyter originally same; distinction by *custom* ("consuetudine"), not divine law ("dispensationis divinae veritate"). Jerome (ad Damasum): Association with Peter's chair doesn't make it the *sole* foundation.
6. African Council (Dist. XCIX): Forbids titles "princeps sacerdotum", "summus sacerdos", "universalis pontifex". This would be heresy if primacy were divine right.
7. Luke 22:24-26 ("Vos autem non sic"): Christ forbids lordship among apostles.

#### Rebuttal

##### Headship

Christ is primary head, but allows subordinate/symbolic heads. Jerome (adv. Jov.): Peter chosen head *to prevent schism* ("ut capite constituto schismatis tollatur occasio"). Bernard applied John 5:19 to church structure. Headless church argument dismissed (cardinals govern).

##### Cyprian

Context (vs. Novatian) proves he meant *Roman* primacy. "Brother" title insignificant. Peter was head (Dionysius). Election methods irrelevant to primacy's *existence*. Augustine quote condemns ambition, not primacy. "Unitas exorta" means jurisdictional *influx* from Peter, not just historical origin. Jerome called East schismatic. Greek church *did* fall from faith; Rome is the unfallen rock (Matt 16).

##### Jerome

Equality refers to *order* (apostolate/episcopate), not *jurisdiction/rule* (regimen). Papacy is dignity, not order above bishop. Nicean council didn't define faith matters affecting primacy. African council forbade haughty *title*, not primacy itself. Best title: "bishop of the universal church". Luke 22 forbids *secular* lordship; Christ presupposed a "maior" and designated Peter ("confirma fratres").

#### Counter-Rebuttal

- **Paul vs. Jerome**: Paul's authority (1 Cor 1/3) outweighs Jerome's interpretation. Paul forbids allegiance to Peter.
- **Bernard/John 5**: Bernard used John 5 allegorically, not as primary proof.
- **Headless Church/Cardinals**: Argument unanswered for pre-cardinal era.
- **Cyprian**: Addressed Roman headship, not universal. "Brother" title significant. Challenges Eck to prove Peter ordained anyone; Luther argues Matthias/Paul divinely appointed (Acts 1, 13). Peter first in honor/number, *not power* ("honoris praerogativa, sed non potestatis"). Nicean council *is* relevant. Augustine quote *was* about equality among bishops. Cyprian's "principal church" applies only to West. Rejects Eck's "influx" theory.
- **Greek Church**: Rejects Eck damning Greek saints. Greek church existed for centuries without submitting to Rome; proves primacy isn't divine right.
- **Matt 16**: Rock is Christ (1 Cor 3:11) or Peter's faith/confession (Augustine, Origen, Bede, Ambrose, Glossa Ord.). Even if Peter, it applies to *whole* church ("ecclesiam meam"), not just Rome. Church unity from faith/baptism/Lord (Eph 4:5), not Roman primate. Jerome (ad Euag.) confirms faith same everywhere.
- **Fathers/Decrees**: Anacletus decree spurious ("frigidissimis decretis"). Councils/Popes are human, must be judged by Scripture (1 Thess 5:21; Canon Significasti). Platina's history shows human origin. Gregory I *rejected* primacy title. Rejects Boniface VIII.
- **Luke 22**: Text forbids *majority* itself, not just ambition. "Confirma fratres" is command, not grant of power.

#### Final Arguments (Summarized)

##### Eck's Position

Repeats Fathers (Anacletus, Cyprian) on primacy of rule distinct from equality of order. Greek church 
*was* schismatic/heretical; submitted at Florence. Matt 16: Rock *is* Peter (Fathers). Condemns Hus/Wycliffe. 
Councils (Constance) are guided by Holy Spirit, cannot err in faith. Distinction between apostolate/rule 
resolves scriptural tensions. Gal 2: Paul respected Peter's authority. John 21 ("Pasce oves"): commission 
of universal pastorship to Peter (Chrysostom, Gregory). Luke 22 ("Confirma fratres"): designation of Peter's 
superior role. Matth 17 (tribute): Peter equated with Christ (Augustine, Ambrose). Papal primacy is divine 
right, proven by Scripture as interpreted by Fathers, Councils, Popes.

##### Luther's Position

Repeats Eck lacks scriptural proof. Matt 16: Rock is Christ/faith (Augustine mostly). 1 Cor 3 / Gal 2 
decisively refute Petrine power over other apostles. Councils can err (Panormitanus on Can. Significasti). 
Fathers must yield to Scripture. Anacletus decree spurious (interprets Cephas as "caput"). Gregory I 
rejected primacy. History shows Greek church independent. Distinction apostolate/rule is human invention. 
John 21 ("Pasce oves"): command to *serve*, not rule; applies to all pastors. Luke 22 ("Confirma fratres"): 
command, not authority. Matth 17 (tribute): subsequent dispute shows apostles didn't see it as primacy. 
Apoc 21 / OT types show *equality*. Concludes primacy is human right/custom, not divine.

### Sin in Good Works Debate

#### Opening

Reiterates charge that Eck's conclusion (denying the righteous *always* sin in good works) is heretical, 
citing Eccles 7:21 ("non est homo iustus... qui faciat bonum et non peccet").

#### Response

Repeats his interpretation: Eccles 7 means no just man is *always* without sin, but doesn't mean he sins 
*in the very act* of doing good. Cites Jerome, Augustine, Ps 17:3 (Lawrence).

#### Rebuttal

Insists Eccles 7 speaks universally ("non est homo... qui faciat... et non peccet") without time limitation. 
Cites Ps 143:2 ("non intres in iudicium... non iustificabitur... omnis vivens"). If the righteous didn't sin 
in good works, they could demand judgment. Cites Ps 116:11 ("omnis homo mendax"). Cites Ps 80:5 ("quousque 
irasceris super orationem servi tui?") - If God is angry even at prayer, sin must be present.

#### Counter-Rebuttal

Karlstadt misapplies universality rule (applies to persons, not time/acts). Repeats Jerome: righteous can 
avoid sin *ad tempus*. Reconciles David's psalms via two kinds of justice (strict vs. gracious/pia). Admits 
venial sin sometimes occurs *during* good works (Gregory, Wm. of Paris), but this isn't *universal*. 
Job 27 ("neque reprehendit me cor meum") contradicts Karlstadt. Isaiah 64 ("pannus menstruatae") compares 
human to *divine* justice. Ps 80:5 interpreted by Jerome/Cassiodorus: God *seems* angry by delaying, 
not *is* angry at the prayer itself due to sin inhering in it.

#### Final Arguments

Cites Augustine (adv. Jul. 4.3) that good works cannot please God if sin is present (implying they 
*do* please, therefore sin isn't disqualifying?). Cites church collects ("De nostra iustitia non 
confidimus", "quia indesinenter peccamus"). Cites Isaiah 64 again, emphasizing "universae iustitiae 
nostrae". Cites Job 9 ("lotus si fuero... tarnen sordibus intingis me"; "Si iustificare me voluero, os 
meum me condemnabit"; "Verebar omnia opera mea"). Cites Gal 5:17 (flesh lusts against spirit) and 
Augustine (Hypognosticon) on constant internal war causing defilement even in good works. Rom 7 
("non enim quod volo bonum, facio") proves imperfection.

#### Final Rebuttal

Rom 7 refers to concupiscence, which isn't sin after baptism unless consented to (Augustine). 
Collects teach humility, not inherent sinfulness of good acts. Concludes Karlstadt lacks 
patristic / scriptural support for his extreme view.

## Aftermath

The arguments that follow largely debate the sacrament of penance, purgatory and indulgences.
