The Catholic Church's greatest crisis emerged not from persecution but from within, 
as Masonic forces executed a centuries-long plan to subvert her teachings and structures. 

# Timeline of the Infiltration of the Vatican

The Catholic Church has always faced external enemies, but her 
most devastating wounds came from those who, like Judas, betrayed 
her from within. What began with secret Masonic instructions in 
the 1820s reached its fulfillment in the Second Vatican Council, 
transforming the visible structures of the Church while preserving 
just enough continuity to maintain the illusion of legitimacy. 

Naturally, due to the secrecy of the masons, it is very hard to pin 
down their instructions and expose their plans to spread religious 
tolerance (also known as apostasy), humanism (man as his own end-goal),
political anarchism and communism.

## Beginning of Freemasonry

While the actual beginnings of organized freemasonry are unclear, the first 
larger Grand Lodge of Freemasonry was established in London on 
June 24, 1717. 

This marked the beginning of organized efforts against the 
Catholic Church, as Freemasonry dedicated itself to spreading the right to
religious freedom, especially from the Catholic Church during the French Revolution -
their goal being "liberty, fraternity, equality and democracy": Replacing
the power hierarchy of Christendom with all authority and truth coming from 
God with authority and truth coming from the people - i.e. "from below".

## Alta Vendita

Around 1829, a crucial discovery was made in the Papal States. Documents 
written by an Italian Masonic lodge called "Alta Vendita" (which originated 
from the Carbonari) were uncovered, containing secret instructions for 
infiltrating the Catholic Church.

The Freemasons, operating with remarkable foresight, determined to destroy 
the Church from within. The Alta Vendita planned to spread revolutionary 
Masonic ideas—particularly the concepts of the French Revolution (liberty, 
equality, fraternity) — into Catholic seminaries and schools, creating 
a new generation of clergy who would think like liberals.

Their ultimate goal, as clearly stated in their secret instruction, was as follows:

> The work which we have undertaken is not the work of a day, nor of a 
> month, nor of a year. It may last many years, a century perhaps, but in our 
> ranks the soldier dies and the fight continues.
>
> We do not mean to win the Popes to our cause, to make them neophytes of 
> our principles, and propagators of our ideas. That would be a ridiculous 
> dream, no matter in what manner events may turn. Should cardinals or 
> prelates, for example, enter, willingly or by surprise, in some manner, 
> into a part of our secrets, it would be by no means a motive to desire 
> their elevation to the See of Peter. That elevation would destroy us. 
> Ambition alone would bring them to apostasy from us. The needs of power 
> would force them to immolate us. That which we ought to demand, that which 
> we should seek and expect, as the Jews expected the Messiah, is a Pope 
> according to our wants.
>
> -- [Alta Vendita, circa 1829](https://archive.is/UIKmP)

They did not seek to convert Popes to their cause but rather to create 
conditions where eventually a Pope would be elected who already thought 
according to revolutionary principles. Their strategy involved not direct 
confrontation but patient infiltration:

> We must find a Pope who convenes a council where our clergy makes the 
> revolution in tiara and choir robe.
>
> -- [Alta Vendita, circa 1829](https://archive.is/UIKmP)

## 1800s: Papal Response

[Pope Pius IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX) obtained these 
documents and immediately published them, also writing his own encyclical 
against Freemasonry. His successor, [Leo XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII), 
even paid from his private funds to translate and republish these 
instructions to warn the faithful.

## Cardinal Rampolla - a mason?

In 1887, Pope Leo XIII, appointed 
[Mariano Rampolla del Tíndaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Rampolla) 
as his Cardinal Secretary of State. While it is rumored that Cardinal Rampolla 
was a Freemason in the "Ordo Templi Orientis" (Order of the Temple of the East),
evidence for this is brittle, as described by [Abbé Ricossa for Solidatium](https://archive.is/wip/IIGXy):

### The 1903 Veto

It is alleged that, while Rampolla was supposed to ascend to the papal throne in 1903,
this was vetoed by Emperor Franz Josef of Austria:

> The late Empress Zita personally told my uncle, Prelate Hesse, the following:
> Emperor Franz Josef came to prove through the Austrian secret service that 
> Mariano Rampolla del Tindero was a Freemason.
>
> -- Dr. Hw. Gregorius Hesse - [YouTube Sermon at 13:59](https://youtu.be/uCEyYsJjwvU?t=837)

However, the alleged source of the Austrian intelligence, Mgr. Jouin, only began 
his anti-Masonic work after 1909, years after the 1903 conclave. Second, Pope St. 
Pius X solemnly condemned the practice of the veto in Commissum nobis (1904), 
forbidding it under pain of excommunication. This action makes little sense if the 
veto had just saved the Church.

### The O.T.O. List

Rampolla's name appeared in a 1919 list published in The Equinox (journal of the 
Ordo Templi Orientis, an occult masonic ) naming purported prominent affiliates.

However, the list is demonstrably fantastical, including figures like Goethe, 
Nietzsche, Wagner, and even mythical figures (Merlin, King Arthur, Pan, Osiris) 
who died long before the O.T.O.'s founding (c. 1904-1906). Second, Mgr. Jouin's 
own Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes (R.I.S.S.), when publishing the 
list, dismissed the inclusion of Rampolla (referred to by initials C...R...) as:

> ...the entirely gratuitous allegation of unscrupulous sectarians [which] 
> cannot constitute any charge against anyone in the world.
>
> -- [R.I.S.S. (1 May 1929), quoted in Sodalitium n°62](https://archive.is/wip/IIGXy)

Ricossa also notes that Rampolla's name was later removed from the list of "saints" 
in Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass canon, which closely mirrored the O.T.O. list.

## Rampolla and Modernism

Despite the non-credible evidence for masonry, Rampolla and his faction were still 
responsible for the modernist groupthink of the next 50 years:

> The Modernist faction that was growing under the long and semi-liberal pontificate 
> of Leo XIII was a strong and potent influence in the Church when Pius X became Pope.
> For example, Cardinal Rampolla was almost elected Pope instead of Cardinal Sarto 
> and had so much power that even though St. Pius X placed him as far from the 
> Roman Curia as he could, his influence remained so extensive that he in effect 
> made the next Pope, Cardinal Della Chiesa (Benedict XV).
>
> -- [Dr. Marian T. Horvat](https://www.dailycatholic.org/mhorvbio.htm) -- [TIA Objections](https://archive.is/8A3sJ#selection-309.1-278.19)

Evidence rather points to Rampolla's problematic relationship with Modernism and his 
opposition to St. Pius X's firm stance against it. The most credible testimony 
comes from the historian Ludwig von Pastor's diary entry recording a 
conversation with St. Pius X himself in May 1914:

> The Pope then spoke longer about Rampolla's correspondence with 
> his Modernist friends, which was found after the Cardinal's death, 
> and said: 'You would be astonished if you were to read it'. Smiling, 
> the Holy Father added that the catastrophe wished for in those letters 
> (namely his own death, which one should await) had nevertheless not 
> occurred. Seriously, His Holiness remarked that it was sad, but true, 
> that Rampolla consisted of two different persons.
>
> —- [Ludwig von Pastor, Tagebücher – Briefe – Erinnerungen, p. 598]()

From his powerful position, Cardinal Rampolla began strategically selecting 
and placing seminarians and priests in important positions. Under his 
protection, the Collegio Capranica in Rome became the center of modernist 
thought. The Italian modernist Fogazzaro, later condemned by Pius X, 
resided at Collegio Capranica and spread his masonic-influenced theories from 
there with the protection of the Secretariat of State.

## Pope Pius X Against Modernism

In 1907, [Pope Pius X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_X) published 
his prophetic encyclical [Pascendi Dominici Gregis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascendi_Dominici_Gregis) 
against Modernism. When congratulated for defeating the Modernists, 
Pius X himself was realistic about the ongoing threat:

> No. I have not destroyed the Modernists; I have only driven them 
> underground, where they will continue their work.
>
> -- [Pope Pius X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_X) -- [Fr. Vincent Micelli, “The Antichrist” (cassette), see fn. 25](https://archive.is/8IzrF)

In Pascendi, Pius X identified the modernist plan to split the Church 
into "progressives and conservatives," creating parties within the 
mystical Body of Christ. He warned that this would lead to "that 
dangerous doctrine raising its head which would make the laity 
the basis of the Church and the basis of these reforms."

## The Seeds of Revolution

The death of Pope Pius X in 1914 did not halt the modernist project; instead, 
it allowed the network cultivated by Cardinal Rampolla to regain control. 
The papacies immediately following saw the continuing influence of this structure, 
fulfilling the Masonic goal of having leaders sympathetic to their ideals steer the Church.

Pope Benedict XV (Giacomo Della Chiesa, 1914-1922) had been directly associated 
with Rampolla for decades, since Chiesa had been Rampollas private secretary.

> Giacomo Della Chiesa, the future Benedict XV, was a Capranica graduate chosen 
> by Rampolla as his private secretary at the Nunciature in Madrid. It was to 
> become a twenty-year relationship.
> 
> -- [Martínez, p. 38]()

His election, along with Pietro Gasparri becoming Secretary of State, effectively 
meant that Rampolla's influence continued despite the earlier veto:

> One wonders if the very old Emperor of Austria-Hungary... was aware... 
> that the Sicilian Cardinal, whose election his veto had prevented had, 
> after all, mounted the papal throne in the person of his two closest 
> assistants [Benedict XV and Gasparri].
> 
> -- [Martínez, p. 45]()

Under Benedict XV, the Vatican began to subtly reverse Pius X's anti-modernist 
stance. He signaled this shift early on:

> [Benedict XV] urged ‘an end to contention and discord in favor of a new sense 
> of brotherhood’. Although few of the laity... would read the encyclical, it 
> gave teachers and preachers everywhere to understand that the war between the 
> Vatican and the Modernists was over.
> 
> -- [Martínez, p. 47]()

He also targeted traditionalist vigilance groups like the Sodalitium Pianum, 
eventually ordering its dissolution under pressure from Secretary Gasparri 
and the French government (Martínez, p. 47).

The pontificate of Pope Pius XI (Achille Ratti, 1922-1939) presented a paradox.
While Pius XI himself issued strongly traditional encyclicals like Quas Primas 
(on the Kingship of Christ) and Mortalium Animos (condemning early ecumenism), 
his reign was marked by the powerful influence of his Secretaries of State—first 
Pietro Gasparri and later Eugenio Pacelli—both deeply connected to the Rampolla 
network. Martínez suggests Pius XI's pontificate may have been "...a running 
battle with his successive Secretaries of State, Gasparri and Pacelli." (Martínez, p. 49)

Gasparri, brought to Rome by Rampolla himself (Martínez, p. 38), wielded 
significant power. His actions often contradicted the Pope's apparent traditionalism, 
demonstrating the entrenched influence of the "alliance." 

Two key examples illustrate this:

### Action Française

Despite Pius XI's earlier praise for Charles Maurras, leader of the traditional 
Catholic and monarchist movement Action Française, Gasparri led the internal 
Vatican push for its condemnation. Martínez states:

> In Rome in 1925 those heirs to Cardinal Rampolla and the Sillon, headed by the 
> Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri, had long been putting pressure on 
> Pope Pius XI to condemn Charles Maurras, whose publications were giving no peace 
> to Freemasonry. Vatican pressure was being seconded by pressure from the French 
> government.
> 
> -- [Martínez, p. 53]()

The eventual condemnation followed a campaign potentially involving manipulated 
information presented to the Pope (Martínez, p. 55).

### The Cristero War

This tragic episode starkly reveals the Vatican Secretariat's power under 
Gasparri to undermine a genuinely Catholic popular uprising against a Masonic, 
anti-clerical government in Mexico. While Pius XI expressed sympathy for 
the martyrs (Iniquis Afflictisquae), Gasparri actively worked against the Cristeros:

> Cardinal Gasparri worked assiduously to dampen the Cristero fire. He advised members 
> of the Mexican hierarchy to refuse encouragement to the fighters. He alerted the 
> bishops of the United States to refuse all appeals for economic aid.
> 
> -- [Martínez, p. 59]()

Ultimately, Gasparri orchestrated the Cristero surrender ("los arreglos") through 
compromising bishops, bypassing those loyal to the cause and leaving the Cristeros 
betrayed (Martínez, pp. 60-61). 

The outcome was devastating:

> As Bishop Gonzalez Valencia explained in Rome to the new secretary of State, 
> Eugenio Pacelli: ‘Gone, forever, the traditional esteem the Mexican has always 
> had for his bishop. I see and I tell you in great sorrow that the shock of this 
> scandal, with its obvious complicity on the part of the Vatican, touches on 
> the Holy See itself and it is so grave that one can foresee a great loss of faith.
> 
> -- [Martínez, pp. 183-184]()

Martínez concludes that Pius XI likely acted against the Cristeros only: "because of 
enormous pressure put on him by individuals determined to get their way. In the end 
those intriguers persuaded him that these ‘arreglos’... were the only way to 
obtain freedom for the Mexican Church." (Martínez, pp. 62-63)

Pius XI reportedly wept when he finally understood the true nature of the betrayal (Martínez, p. 63).

## Pius XII and Bugnini

These events demonstrate how the structure established by Rampolla, operating through 
key figures like Gasparri, could effectively neutralize traditional Catholic movements 
and influence papal decisions, even when the Pope himself held seemingly orthodox views. 
The seeds of the revolution, planted decades earlier, were taking firm root within 
the Vatican's highest offices.

Pius XI was succeeded by Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli, 1939-1958), the very man Rampolla 
had groomed and who had served under Gasparri. He prophetically told a friend: "I am the 
last Pope of the old Church." During Pius XII's papacy, the liturgical landscape began 
its transformation. The first reforms by [Annibale Bugnini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annibale_Bugnini),
the architect of the Novus Ordo, altered the Holy Week in the 1950s. Martínez notes 
Pius XII's active support for Bugnini's commission:

> We enjoyed the full confidence of Pius XII who was kept informed of our work by Msgr. 
> Montini and even more by Fr. Bea, his confessor. Thanks to these intermediaries we 
> could arrive at remarkable results even in periods when the Pope’s illness prevented 
> anyone else from seeing him.
> 
> -- [Bugnini, quoted by Martínez, p. 97]()

A new translation of the Psalms further eroded liturgical tradition, particularly 
Gregorian chant (Martínez, p. 77, 95). By 1958, liturgical changes were widespread, 
with vernacular readings permitted and only the Canon of the Mass remaining globally 
untouched in Latin. The Chinese already had permission to celebrate Mass in their 
native language except for the Canon, and in Germany priests were allowed to read 
Scripture in German at the altar.

## Strategic Episcopal Appointments

Bishops who would later play key roles at Vatican II were appointed in the 1950s to 
positions that traditionally received the Cardinal's hat, including Cardinals 
[Alfrink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Jan_Alfrink), 
[Frings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Frings), 
[Döpfner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_D%C3%B6pfner), 
[König](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_K%C3%B6nig), 
[Suenens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Jozef_Suenens), Lienhart, 
and [Bea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Bea).

[Giovanni Battista Montini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI) (future 
Pope Paul VI), who had led communist Roman student youth in the 1930s and 
had translated Jacques Maritain's problematic book "Integral Humanism" 
into Italian with a glowing preface, was appointed Archbishop of Milan 
despite his known communist sympathies.

## Vatican II and the Revolution Realized

In 1958, [Angelo Roncalli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII), 
who had previously been under suspicion by the Holy Office, was elected Pope, 
taking the name John XXIII. In 1959, he announced the Second Vatican Council.

The Council was guided by modernist Cardinals under the leadership of 
[Eugène Tisserant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Tisserant) 
and [Giacomo Lercaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Lercaro) (who 
was described by those who knew his private opinions as "a second 
Martin Luther"). They rejected the preparations made by the relatively 
traditional Roman Curia.

The Council documents were written by *periti* (theological experts) who 
had previously been suspected or condemned by the Holy Office, including 
[Karl Rahner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rahner) (expert for Cardinal 
König), [Hans Küng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_K%C3%BCng) (expert for 
Cardinal Frings), [Yves Congar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Congar), 
and [Henri de Lubac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Lubac).

Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the Alta Vendita:

> You will bring yourselves as friends around the Apostolic Chair. You will 
> have fished up a Revolution in Tiara and Cope, marching with Cross and 
> banner—a Revolution which needs only to be spurred on a little to put the 
> four quarters of the world on fire.
>
> -- [Alta Vendita, circa 1829](https://archive.is/UIKmP)

## The Post-Conciliar Church

The Second Vatican Council institutionalized the destruction of the Church 
from within, creating what Bishop [Tissier de Mallerais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Tissier_de_Mallerais) 
accurately called "a Gnostic sect". The concept of Tradition was redefined in 
Dei Verbum #8, which introduced the idea of "progress" in Tradition through 
the study and contemplation of the faithful and their experiences—precisely 
what Pius X had condemned in 1907.

[Pope Paul VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI) explicitly declared: 
"We must abandon the idea that Tradition is unchangeable." He even proudly announced 
that Catholics faced a revolution shortly before publishing his new Missal.

As we survey the wreckage of post-conciliar Catholicism—empty seminaries, 
abandoned religious houses, liturgical chaos, and doctrinal confusion—we see 
the fruits of this centuries-long subversion. The revolution prophesied in 
the Alta Vendita documents has been accomplished with devastating efficiency. 
Yet Christ promised that the gates of hell would not prevail against His 
Church, and the true Faith cannot be extinguished.

For Catholics living amid this crisis, the clear guidance remains: hold fast 
to the perennial teachings and practices of the Church. The Faith is not 
determined by the latest papal pronouncement or theological fashion, but by 
what has been believed "everywhere, always, and by all" (St. Vincent of Lérins). 

Remain faithful to what has not changed through the centuries, maintain access 
to valid sacraments, cultivate the supernatural life, and trust in Divine 
Providence for the eventual restoration of Holy Mother Church.
