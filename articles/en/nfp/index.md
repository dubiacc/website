NFP changes marriage's primary end from procreation to subjective "love" or "unity",
makes marriage as a contract undefinable, replaces divine providence with 
human calculation and subtly promotes sin, ultimately destroying the family.

# Is Natural Family Planning Catholic?

In an age saturated with compromise and confusion, even within the Church, 
few deviations from perennial teaching have become as normalized and accepted 
as the practice commonly known as "Natural" Family Planning (NFP). 

Natural Family Planning (NFP), despite its widespread acceptance, 
contradicts the Church's historical teaching on marriage and procreation. 
Far from being a morally neutral method of birth regulation, NFP 
fundamentally reorders marital ends, prioritizing personal choice over 
divine mandate. Pope Pius XI's encyclica "Casti Connubii" clearly condemns 
this mindset that has contributed to family breakdown under the guise 
of responsible parenthood.

## Why NFP Seems Plausible

Proponents marshal several arguments in NFP’s defense, arguments which have 
sadly gained widespread traction:

*   NFP merely observes natural cycles, unlike artificial contraception which actively obstructs them. Therefore, it works with nature.
*   The Sacred Penitentiary in the 19th century or Pius XII's allegedly addresses in the 1950s as evidence of long-standing acceptance. Therefore, it is traditional.
*   The "unitive" and "procreative" meanings or significances of the marital act are inseparable, according to modern theology. NFP supposedly respects both, allowing couples to express unity even when avoiding procreation.
*   NFP requires communication and discipline, which are virtues strengthening the marriage.
*   Couples should "discern" their family size based on their conditions, using NFP as the tool for this discernment.

These arguments, however well-intentioned or widely repeated, fail to 
withstand scrutiny when measured against the immutable truths articulated 
in Casti Connubii and the broader Tradition.

## Primary End of Marriage

Pius XI, writing prophetically in 1930, dismantled the foundations upon which NFP 
would later be built. His encyclical "Casti Connubii" (On Chaste Marriage) relentlessly 
affirms that the primary end of marriage, its defining purpose established by God, 
is "the procreation and the education of children" ([CC, 17](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-391.341-391.418)). 

All other goods are secondary and must be subordinated.

> The Apostle himself is therefore a witness that marriage is for the 
> sake of generation: "I wish," he says, "young girls to marry." And, 
> as if someone said to him, "Why?", he immediately adds: "To bear 
> children, to be mothers of families".
> 
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [De bono coniug., cap. 24 n. 32](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-343.380-343.734)

There is no co-equal "unitive" end in the essential structure of marriage according to this 
perennial teaching. Love is the *context* and *ideal manner*, but procreation is the 
defining purpose of the institution and the conjugal act itself.

## Deliberate Frustration 

> The conjugal act is destined primarily by nature for the begetting of children, those 
> who in exercising it deliberately frustrate its natural power and purpose sin against 
> nature and commit a deed which is shameful and intrinsically vicious.
> 
> -- [Casti Conubii, 54](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-695.170-695.411). 

NFP, used to avoid conception, is precisely this: the deliberate use of timing (a technique 
based on natural knowledge) to exercise the conjugal act while frustrating its natural power 
and primary purpose during fertile times. Whether the frustration is achieved chemically, 
mechanically, or chronologically is irrelevant to the intrinsic disordering of the act from 
its God-given end.

## Do Grave Circumstances permit NFP?

No. Pius XI foresaw the appeal to difficult circumstances: 

> But **no reason, however grave**, may be put forward by which anything intrinsically 
> against nature may become conformable to nature and morally good.
> 
> -- [Casti Conubii 54](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-695.5-695.151)

This single sentence obliterates the entire "grave reasons" framework introduced later by 
Pius XII (a framework itself problematic, shifting the basis from nature to a questionable 
"duty"). If frustrating the act's primary end is intrinsically against nature, no reason 
can make it morally licit. 

The encyclical explicitly affirms that grace is always sufficient for spouses to remain 
chaste when necessary ([CC 61](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-751.263-751.446)). 
The licit option is continence, not calculated avoidance.

## A traditional practice?

The claim that the Sacred Penitentiary approved NFP in the 1850s or 1880s is 
demonstrably false. Those responses addressed specific pastoral queries, primarily 
concerning cooperation with a spouse already sinning (e.g., through onanism) or clarifying 
that intercourse during naturally infertile times (like post-menopause or when sterility is 
present for reasons *extrinsic* to the couple's will) is not sinful *in itself*. 

Crucially, they *never* approved the *deliberate restriction* of intercourse *only* 
to infertile periods *for the purpose of avoiding children*. In fact, the 1880 response 
implicitly *condemned* NFP used for avoiding numerous children, permitting the suggestion 
of NFP *only* as a desperate, last-resort means to dissuade a partner from the "detestable 
crime of onanism," *not* as a generally acceptable practice. 

Casti Connubii itself later condemned NFP by name, calling it a "perversion of 
the right order" ([CC, 59](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-735.137-735.193)) that could 
only be reluctantly *tolerated*, not approved, in the innocent spouse when trying to deter 
the other from worse sin. The idea of NFP as a long-approved practice is a historical 
fabrication used to lend false legitimacy. 

St. Augustine had already condemned the Manicheans for the same practice centuries earlier.

## The art of sinning subtly

Pius XI’s warning against "exaggerated physiological education" teaching the "art of 
sinning in a subtle way" ([CC, 108](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1127.282-1127.429)) 
perfectly describes NFP. It substitutes scientific knowledge and technique for the virtue of 
chastity and trust in God's Providence. It subtly shifts the focus from openness to God's 
will regarding life to human control and calculation.

## Turning a Wife into a Mistress

When procreation is deliberately excluded from the conjugal act during fertile times, 
what remains? Pius XI quotes Augustine:

> If such were their character from the beginning, they have not come together by 
> wedlock but by debauchery. But if the two are not alike in such sin, I boldly 
> declare either that the woman is, so to say, the husband's harlot; or the 
> man the wife's adulterer.
>
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [De nupt. et concupisc., 17. cap. XV.](https://archive.is/IvHP4#selection-2199.423-2207.70)

Prioritizing the physical union while actively thwarting its primary natural end 
is a form of "idolatry of the flesh" ([CC, 107](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1119.124-1119.261)). 
The conjugal act is only "honest wedlock" when ordered primarily to offspring.

## Rejection of Divine providence

The entire NFP enterprise rests on the "overrated independence of private judgment 
and that false autonomy of human reason" ([CC, 104](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1095.6-1095.152)) 
which Pius XI condemned. Couples are told to "discern" based on subjective factors, effectively judging 
God's revealed will ("Increase and multiply") by their own circumstances and desires. 
This replaces trust in God's "farseeing providence" ([CC, 80](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-903.900-903.1153)) 
with human planning and control, a hallmark of modern pride.

### Redefining Marriage

The acceptance of NFP *necessitated* a redefinition of marriage. If the act need 
not always be ordered to procreation, then procreation cannot be the sole primary 
end. "Love" or "unity" (undefined, subjective concepts) had to be elevated to co-equal 
status, shifting marriage from an objective *contract* for rights ordered to a 
specific end ([CC, 59](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-735.814-735.926)) 
to a subjective *covenant* based on feelings:

> These enemies of marriage go further, however, when they substitute for that true 
> and solid love, which is the basis of conjugal happiness, a certain vague compatibility 
> of temperament. This they call sympathy and assert that, since it is the only bond 
> by which husband and wife are linked together, when it ceases the marriage is completely 
> dissolved. What else is this than to build a house upon sand?
>
> -- [Pius XI.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI) -- [Casti Conubii, 78](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-887.5-887.357)

Notably, this heretical teaching is even espoused by the Eastern "Orthodox":

> The human marriage experience becomes impossible after the spiritual death of love.
>
> -- [St. John the Evangelist Orthodox Church](https://archive.is/2rpC4#selection-925.2-925.85)

Since, for the Eastern "Orthodox", marriage is not a contract, but an experience, they 
justify going against Jesus' teaching in Luke 16:18 with their definition of "oikonomia", 
to rather "sin than to lose ones soul" (ignoring the fact that to sin mortally even once 
*equals* losing ones soul).

## NFP and Divorce

Once marriage is legally redefined (even implicitly within Church structures) as 
being primarily about love, unity, and mutual fulfillment (concepts inherently subjective 
and fluctuating), the grounds for dissolution explode. 

If the *essence* of marriage is a subjective state of love or psychological compatibility, 
then its absence (or perceived absence) logically implies the marriage never truly existed 
in its essence. This subjective standard, enshrined in Canon 1095's "lack of due discretion" 
(often interpreted as psychological incapacity for this ill-defined "union"), is the direct 
cause of the annulment crisis. 

The 338 annulments in the US in 1968 ballooning to over 27,000 by 2006 isn't due to sudden 
mass psychological incompetence; it's due to changing the legal definition of marriage to 
accommodate the NFP mindset. It creates the "disastrous ease of obtaining divorce" (or its 
functional equivalent, easy annulment) which Pius XI lamented ([CC, 110]()).

## Feminism, Disorder and Rejection of Gender Roles

By making procreation optional and secondary, NFP provides the theological underpinning 
for the feminist rejection of traditional family roles. If children are not the primary 
purpose, then motherhood is not woman's primary domestic vocation. The distinct, complementary 
roles ordained by God and affirmed by St. Paul (Ephesians 5) – the husband as head, exercising 
loving authority, and the wife as heart, offering willing obedience ([CC, 26-29]()) – become 
nonsensical in a marriage redefined as an equal partnership pursuing mutual fulfillment. 
NFP facilitates this "false liberty and unnatural equality" that ultimately debases 
womanhood and destroys family order ([CC, 75]()).

## Conclusion

The widespread acceptance of NFP represents a profound crisis in the Church's understanding 
of marriage. It is not a legitimate application of natural law but a subtle subversion of 
it, rooted in a modernist desire to accommodate worldly pressures and elevate subjective
experience over divine ordinance. *Casti Connubii* remains the authoritative benchmark, 
exposing NFP as intrinsically disordered, historically unfounded in Church approval, and 
corrosive to the very fabric of marriage and family life.

Its acceptance has paved the way for redefining marriage around subjective love, leading 
inevitably to the chaos of easy annulments and the breakdown of God-given family roles. 
It is an "art of sinning subtly," an "idolatry of the flesh" disguised as responsible stewardship. 
Catholics seeking to live in accordance with God's plan for marriage must reject this illusion 
and embrace the fullness of the Church's perennial teaching: marriage ordered unreservedly 
to the blessing of children, with complete trust in God's grace and Providence. Only by 
returning to this objective truth can the "depraved marriage" ([CC, 107]()) fostered by 
modern errors be overcome, and true Christian marriage be restored.
