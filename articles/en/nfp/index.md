NFP changes marriage's primary end from procreation to subjective 'love' or 'unity.' 
It renders the marriage contract undefinable, replaces divine providence with 
human calculation, subtly promotes sin, and ultimately destroys the family.

# Is Natural Family Planning Catholic?

In an age saturated with compromise and confusion, even within the Church, 
few deviations from perennial teaching have become as normalized and accepted 
as the practice commonly known as "Natural" Family Planning (NFP). 

Natural Family Planning (NFP), despite its widespread acceptance, 
contradicts the Church's historical teaching on marriage and procreation. 
Far from being a morally neutral method of birth regulation, NFP 
fundamentally reorders marital ends, prioritizing personal choice over 
divine mandate. Pope Pius XI's encyclical "Casti Connubii" clearly condemns 
this mindset that has contributed to family breakdown under the guise 
of responsible parenthood.

## Why NFP Seems Plausible

Proponents marshal several arguments in NFP’s defense, arguments which 
have sadly gained widespread traction:

*   NFP merely observes natural cycles, unlike artificial contraception which actively obstructs them. Therefore, it works with nature.
*   The Sacred Penitentiary in the 1800s and Pius XII in the 1950s allegedly allow NFP - therefore, it is a traditional practice, with evidence of long-standing acceptance.
*   The "unitive" and "procreative" meanings or significances of the marital act are inseparable, according to modern theology. NFP supposedly respects both, allowing couples to express unity even when avoiding procreation.
*   NFP requires communication and discipline, which are virtues strengthening the marriage.
*   Couples should "discern" their family size based on their conditions, using NFP as the tool for this discernment.

These arguments, however well-intentioned or widely repeated, fail to 
withstand scrutiny when measured against the immutable truths articulated 
in Casti Connubii and the broader Tradition.

## Primary End of Marriage

Pius XI, in his encyclical "Casti Connubii" (On Chaste Marriage) relentlessly 
affirms that the primary end of marriage, its defining purpose 
established by God, is "the procreation and the education of children" 
([CC, 17](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-391.341-391.418)). 

All other goods are secondary and must be subordinated.

> The Apostle himself is therefore a witness that marriage is for the 
> sake of generation: "I wish," he says, "young girls to marry." And, 
> as if someone said to him, "Why?", he immediately adds: "To bear 
> children, to be mothers of families".
> 
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [De bono coniug., cap. 24 n. 32](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-343.380-343.734)

There is no co-equal "unitive" end in the essential structure of marriage 
according to this perennial teaching. Love is the *context* and *ideal manner*, 
but procreation is the defining purpose of the institution and the conjugal act itself.

## Deliberate Frustration 

> The conjugal act is destined primarily by nature for the begetting of children, those 
> who **in exercising it deliberately frustrate its natural power and purpose** sin against 
> nature and commit a deed which is shameful and intrinsically vicious.
> 
> -- [Casti Conubii, 54](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-695.170-695.411). 

Now, the sedevacantist Bishop Pivarunas (CMRI) argues that 'NFP is not a deliberate 
frustration, as the timing of NFP cannot be perfect.' While this statement holds 
partial truth, he makes no distinction between unintentional and intentional NFP. 
He completely ignores that it was definitely seen as sinful by the Sacred Penitentiary 
in the 1880s:

> Q1: Whether married couples may have intercourse during such sterile periods 
> without committing mortal or venial sin?
>
> Q2: Whether the confessor may suggest such a procedure (NFP) either to the wife 
> who **detests the onanism of her husband but cannot correct him**, or to either 
> spouse who shrinks from having numerous children?
> 
> -- [Fr. Le Conte, 1880](https://archive.is/6sktD#selection-671.3-697.286)

> A: Married couples who use their marriage right in the aforesaid manner (note: regarding Q1) 
> are not to be disturbed, and the confessor may suggest the opinion in question, 
> cautiously, however, to those married people **whom he has tried in vain by other means 
> to dissuade from the detestable crime of onanism** (note: regarding Q2). 
>
> -- [Sacred Penitentiary, June 16, 1880](https://archive.is/6sktD#selection-697.0-702.0)

Note that the distinction here is the *intention* between Q1 and Q2: Intercourse during 
sterile periods in itself is not a sin, but intercourse during sterile periods 
*specifically for the shrinking of the family*, that is, to avoid conception 
(which equals contra-ception), is only tolerated (not approved) to avoid onanism, 
that is, masturbation. 

If NFP was truly without sinfulness, why would the answer from the S.P. include 
terms such as "cautiously" and "to dissuade from onanism"? There is absolutely zero "endorsement" 
here, only a toleration to prevent the worse sin of onanism, which Bishop Pivarunas completely 
misinterprets. He then cites the modernist Fr. Halligan (1917–1997) to support the claim that 
'NFP is lawful given sufficient reason,' who in turn cites 'common teaching of theologians' 
for his justification:

> Deliberately to limit the use of marital relations exclusively to the sterile periods 
> in order to avoid conception (i.e., to practice periodic continence or rhythm) is, according 
> to the common teaching of theologians, morally lawful in actual practice if there is mutual 
> consent, sufficient reason and due safeguards against attendant dangers.
>
> -- [Fr. Halligan, cited by Bp. Pivarunas](https://archive.is/6sktD#selection-737.56-737.399)

Fr. Halligan is simply wrong here, as his teaching directly contradicts the answer 
given by the Sacred Penitentiary in 1853:

> Q: Certain married couples, relying on the opinion of learned physicians, are 
> convinced that there are several days each month in which conception cannot occur.
>  Are those who do not use the marriage right except on such days to be disturbed, 
> especially if they have legitimate reasons for abstaining from the conjugal act?”
> 
> A: Those spoken of in the request are not to be disturbed, 
> **providing that they do nothing to impede conception**.
>
> -- [Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, 1853](https://archive.is/6sktD#selection-607.0-612.0)

The latter half is the crucial distinction: Whether NFP done by accident or with the 
intention of limiting family size. Only the first one is not a sin: this is advised to 
calm the conscience of scrupulous couples who worry whether they're sinning on certain 
days and not on others. However, it is not an endorsement of NFP and, even if it were 
considered one, it was superseded by the teaching of Pius XI later on.

## Learning the art of subtle sinning

Pius XI warns against this "extensive physiological education" practiced today, 
even though modern "Catholics" even think they're hardcore traditionalists 
because they use NFP rather than condoms:

> Such wholesome instruction and religious training in regard to Christian marriage will 
> be quite different from that *exaggerated physiological education* by means of which, 
> in these times of ours, some reformers of married life make pretense of helping those 
> joined in wedlock, laying much stress on these physiological matters, in which 
> *is learned rather the art of sinning in a subtle way than the virtue of living chastely*.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 108](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1127.6-1127.429)

This "exaggerated physiological education" addresses intentional NFP directly: with 
its various methods, trackers, apps, etc. - all done with the intention of lust 
without consequences. Therefore, it is definitely a "subtle sin" to act as this 
modernist "Catholic" woman does - recalling her sadness about not being able to use 
contraception, but having to use NFP instead:

> NFP (for avoiding pregnancy) is the complete opposite of a woman's natural 
> sex drive cycle. Basically I would not be able to have sex when I most want it 
> [editorial note: on fertile days, women usually have a higher sex drive] and 
> only be able to when I least want it.
>
> [...] 
> 
> After starting to track my cervical mucus, I felt a genuine wave of sadness 
> come over me, like I am accepting a death sentence (to my sexuality), like 
> I am pretending to want to do something I truly don't.
>
> -- ["nfp" topic on r/Catholicism](https://archive.is/Gf2ec#selection-1413.2-1413.206)

Now, obviously she here complains from the modernist perspective, lamenting her inability 
to use regular contraception -- but even she recognizes that it goes directly against her 
nature as a woman to *only* have relations on non-fertile days (in order to contracept).

This is the result of what you eventually end up with when practicing NFP: tracking mucus, 
Marquette method, temperatures, ovulation cycles, etc. - all of that effort in order to 
**intentionally prevent** God's will - and Bishop Pivarunas still argues that this elaborate 
scheme is not a "deliberate frustration" and does not "impede contraception"?

This simply flies in the face of Pius XI's warning: whether the frustration is achieved 
chemically, mechanically, or chronologically is irrelevant to the intrinsic disordering 
of the act from its God-given end. Intentional NFP, as practiced above, is most definitely 
intentional contra-ception. 

The softness on NFP by Pius XII (with his "grave reasons" justification) later on led 
to his successor Paul VI Paul VI facing great difficulty in justifying his teaching 
against contraception: if chronological contraception is allowed, then there is absolutely 
no moral difference to artificial contraception, since the *intention* is the same.

NFP substitutes scientific knowledge and technique for the virtue of chastity and 
trust in God's Providence, it subtly shifts the focus from openness to God's 
will regarding life to human control and calculation.

## Consequences of NFP

NFP has various, severe consequences, even if it prevents people from using 
artificial contraception or - God forbid - abortion via "the morning after pill".

### Turning a Wife into a Mistress

When procreation is deliberately excluded from the conjugal act during 
fertile times, what remains? Pius XI quotes Augustine:

> If such were their character from the beginning, they have not come together by 
> wedlock but by debauchery. But if the two are not alike in such sin, I boldly 
> declare either that the woman is, so to say, the husband's harlot; or the 
> man the wife's adulterer.
>
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [De nupt. et concupisc., 17. cap. XV.](https://archive.is/IvHP4#selection-2199.423-2207.70)

Prioritizing the physical union while actively thwarting its primary 
natural end is a form of "idolatry of the flesh" ([CC, 107](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1119.124-1119.261)). 
The conjugal act is only "honest wedlock" when ordered primarily to offspring.

St. Augustine had already condemned the Manicheans for the same practice centuries earlier,
although their reasoning was only slightly different (wanting to contracept since they saw 
the "Divine Light" being trapped in human flesh, which they taught, was imprisonment and inherently evil) - 
still, he foresaw their practice of observing cycles being rooted in passions:

> Is it not you who hold that begetting children, by which souls are confined in flesh, 
> is a greater sin than cohabitation? Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe 
> as much as possible the time when a woman, after her purification, is most likely to 
> conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that time, lest the soul should be entangled 
> in flesh? This proves that you approve of having a wife, not for the procreation of children, 
> but for the gratification of passion. 
>
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [On the Morals of the Manicheans, ch. 18, p. 65](https://archive.is/f9mb5#selection-2839.201-2855.152)

The idea that "using the Marquette method to avoid conception is traditional Catholic teaching" 
is simply untenable, at least since 388 AD - if Augustine and Pius XI would truly "allow NFP", 
why do they both write about continence as an alternative - and not : if a couple cannot 
contain themselves, they should simply "watch the days of the menses?" It is obvious that only 
licit and Catholic option is continence, not calculated avoidance, justified by out-of-context 
quotes from the 20th century that distort their original meaning.

### Rejection of Divine Providence

The entire NFP enterprise rests on the "overrated independence of 
private judgment and that false autonomy of human reason", which Pius XI condemned:

> Wherefore, let the faithful also be on their guard against the overrated independence 
> of private judgment and that false autonomy of human reason. For it is quite foreign 
> to everyone bearing the name of a Christian to trust his own mental powers with such 
> pride as to agree only with those things which he can examine from their inner nature, [...]
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 104](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1095.6-1095.152)

Couples are told to "discern" based on subjective factors, 
effectively judging God's revealed will ("Increase and multiply") 
by their own circumstances and desires. This replaces trust in God's 
"farseeing providence" ([CC, 80](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-903.900-903.1153)) 
with human planning and control, a hallmark of modern pride.

### Redefining Marriage

As a secondary cause, after turning the purpose of the marital act from procreation to 
lust, the acceptance of NFP even *necessitated* a redefinition of marriage. If the act
need not always be ordered to procreation, then procreation cannot be the sole primary 
end. 

"Love" or "unity" (undefined, subjective concepts) had to therefore be elevated to co-equal 
status, shifting marriage from an objective *contract* for rights ordered to a 
specific end ([CC, 59](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-735.814-735.926)) 
to a subjective *covenant* based on feelings:

> These enemies of marriage go further, however, when they substitute for that true 
> and solid love, which is the basis of conjugal happiness, a certain vague compatibility 
> of temperament. This they call sympathy and assert that, since it is the only bond 
> by which husband and wife are linked together, when it ceases the marriage is completely 
> dissolved. What else is this than to build a house upon sand?
>
> -- [Pius XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI) -- [Casti Conubii, 78](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-887.5-887.357)

Notably, this heretical teaching is even espoused by the Eastern "Orthodox", see 
[Are Annulments Catholic?](/en/annulments).

Augustine goes even further, after condemning the Manicheans for their mistress-wives:

> In marriage, as the marriage law declares, the man and woman come together for the procreation 
> of children. Therefore whoever makes the procreation of children a greater sin than copulation, 
> forbids marriage, and makes the woman not a wife, but a mistress, who for some gifts presented 
> to her is joined to the man to gratify his passion. 
> 
> Where there is a wife there must be marriage. But there is no marriage where motherhood is not 
> in view; therefore neither is there a wife. In this way you forbid marriage.
>
> -- [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) -- [On the Morals of the Manicheans, ch. 18, p. 65](https://archive.is/f9mb5#selection-2855.153-2867.281)

### NFP and Divorce

Once marriage is therefore legally redefined (even implicitly within Church structures) as 
being primarily about love, unity, and mutual fulfillment (concepts inherently subjective 
and fluctuating), the grounds for dissolution explode. 

If the *essence* of marriage is a subjective state of love or psychological compatibility, 
then its absence (or perceived absence) logically implies the marriage never truly existed 
in its essence. This subjective standard, enshrined in Canon 1095's "lack of due discretion" 
(often interpreted as psychological incapacity for this ill-defined "union"), is the direct 
cause of the annulment crisis. 

The 338 annulments in the US in 1968 ballooning to over 27,000 by 2006 isn't due to sudden 
mass psychological incompetence; it's due to changing the legal definition of marriage to 
accommodate the NFP mindset. It creates the "disastrous ease of obtaining divorce" (or its 
functional equivalent, easy annulment) which Pius XI lamented:

> Much more ought you, Venerable Brethren, [...] by every fitting means, oppose [...] 
> that disastrous ease in obtaining divorce by an enduring love in the bond of marriage 
> and by the inviolate pledge of fidelity given even to death.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 106](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-1111.699-1111.1002)

### Feminism and Disorder

If children are not the primary purpose, then motherhood is not woman's primary domestic vocation. 
The distinct, complementary roles ordained by God and affirmed by St. Paul (Ephesians 5) – 
the husband as head, exercising loving authority, and the wife as heart, offering willing 
obedience – become nonsensical in a marriage redefined as an equal partnership 
pursuing mutual fulfillment. 

> For if the man is the head, the woman is the heart, and as he occupies the chief place 
> in ruling, so she may and ought to claim for herself the chief place in love.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 27](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-471.857-471.1021)

By making procreation optional and secondary, NFP provides the theological underpinning 
for the feminist rejection of traditional family roles. Whenever lust becomes primary, the woman,
usually having less sexual drive and being in the "chief place of love", now holds the keys
over the entire marriage, until it slowly erodes to a lustful debate about "rendering the obligation"
and "living out one's sexuality".

NFP facilitates this "false liberty and unnatural equality" that ultimately debases 
womanhood and destroys family order:

> This, however, is not the true emancipation of woman, nor that rational and 
> exalted liberty which belongs to the noble office of a Christian woman and wife [...]
>
> More than this, this false liberty and unnatural equality with the husband is to 
> the detriment of the woman herself, for if the woman descends from her truly 
> regal throne to which she has been raised within the walls of the home by means 
> of the Gospel, she will soon be reduced to the old state of slavery (if not in 
> appearance, certainly in reality) and become as amongst the pagans the mere 
> instrument of man.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 75](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-863.5-863.844)

## Do Grave Circumstances permit NFP?

No. Pius XI foresaw the appeal to difficult circumstances: 

> But **no reason, however grave**, may be put forward by which anything intrinsically 
> against nature may become conformable to nature and morally good.
> 
> -- [Casti Conubii, 54](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-695.5-695.151)

This single sentence obliterates the entire "grave reasons" framework introduced later by 
Pius XII (a framework itself problematic, shifting the basis from nature to a questionable 
"duty"). If frustrating the act's primary end is intrinsically against nature, no reason 
can make it morally licit. 

The encyclical explicitly affirms that grace is always sufficient for spouses to remain 
chaste when necessary ([CC 61](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-751.263-751.446)):

> There is no possible circumstance in which husband and wife cannot, strengthened 
> by the grace of God, fulfill faithfully their duties and preserve in wedlock 
> their chastity unspotted.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 61](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-751.145-751.446)

Ironically, the idea that "we have to use NFP, it is not possible to contain ourselves otherwise"
is put under anathema by the Council of Trent:

> Let no one be so rash as to assert that which the Fathers of the Council have placed 
> under anathema, namely, that there are precepts of God impossible for the just to observe. 
> God does not ask the impossible, but by His commands, instructs you to do what you are 
> able, to pray for what you are not able that He may help you.
>
> -- [Casti Conubii, 61](https://archive.is/boRjM#selection-751.532-751.856)

## Conclusion

The acceptance of NFP has paved the way for redefining marriage around subjective love, leading 
inevitably to the chaos of easy annulments and the breakdown of God-given family roles. 
It is an "art of sinning subtly," an "idolatry of the flesh" disguised as responsible stewardship. 
Catholics seeking to live in accordance with God's plan for marriage must reject this illusion 
and embrace the fullness of the Church's perennial teaching: marriage ordered unreservedly 
to the blessing of children, with complete trust in God's grace and Providence. Only by 
returning to this objective truth can the "depraved marriage" that is fostered by 
modern errors be overcome - and true Christian marriage be restored.

The widespread acceptance of NFP represents a profound crisis in the Church's understanding 
of marriage. It is not a legitimate application of natural law but a subtle subversion of 
it, rooted in a modernist desire to accommodate worldly pressures and elevate subjective
experience over divine ordinance. *Casti Connubii* remains the authoritative benchmark, 
exposing NFP as intrinsically disordered, historically unfounded in Church approval, and 
corrosive to the very fabric of marriage and family life.
