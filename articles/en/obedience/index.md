# How much obedience do we owe the Pope?

We live in times of unparalleled confusion, where, as Abbé Roche foresaw, the 
"heresy, that the Pope can do everything" (hyperpapalism) has taken root in many minds.
On the other side of the aisle stand those that dispose of the pope (sedevacantists, 
see [Does a heretical pope lose his office?](/en/sede-vacante)). 

This site, run with the approval of the SSPX Resistance priests, stands in the middle 
position, which is often overlooked. But as we will see, moderation is a virtue, even 
in theological matters.

## Unity of the Church?

**Objection 1:** It would seem that Catholics owe absolute and unquestioning obedience. 
For Christ said to Peter, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church"
(Mt 16:18), and "whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in
heaven" (Mt 16:19). The First Vatican Council teaches the Pope is the principle of
unity. To question is to attack this foundation.

**Sed contra:** The Pope’s authority is **for** unity *in the Faith* (not unity in the pope).
The job of St. Peter is to "keep the Faith", to be a sheperd. His authority serves the Faith, 
but faith does not serve authority. When an exercise of authority demonstrably departs from 
or harms the Faith, obedience in that specific matter may cease to be a virtue, and in fact, 
becomes a sin.

## Indefectibility?

**Objection 2:** Some argue that since the Church is indefectible, the Holy
Spirit would prevent a Pope from commanding anything universally harmful or heretical
through his official disciplinary acts. Therefore, obedience must always be rendered,
trusting in this divine protection.

**Sed contra:** The Church’s indefectibility means she cannot *universally*
promulgate error *as binding dogma* or defect from the Faith. It does not mean every
papal disciplinary act is wise, prudent, or cannot be resisted if it demonstrably harms
souls or the Faith. The Holy Spirit's assistance protects the Pope from *defining*
heresy, not necessarily from personal error or harmful non-infallible actions.

## Ignatius of Loyola

**Objection 3:**: The holy St. Ignatius of Loyola instructs us:

> To be right in everything, we ought always to hold that the white which I see is
> black, if the hierarchical church so decides it.
>
> -- [St. Ignatius of Loyola]() -- [Spiritual Exercises, Rules for Thinking with the
> Church, 13]()

This implies a total submission of judgment, even against clear evidence.

**Sed contra:** St. Ignatius’s rule is about the *disposition* to believe
what the Church teaches in matters of Faith, not to accept as true what is manifestly
false to reason or to obey sinful commands. It does not mean that, if the Pope commands 
me to (physically or spiritually) jump off a cliff, I say: "yes sir" and jump. 

Even Bellarmine states that if a Pope commanded vice, the Church must not obey 
him in that, lest she sin against conscience.

## Limits of papal authority

Pope Innocent III, a great Pontiff, taught concerning the Sacraments that some elements 
are of divine institution and cannot be substantially altered even by a Pope. He also stated:

> The faith is necessary for me to such an extent that, having God as my only judge in
> other sins, I could however be judged by the Church for sins I might commit in
> matters of faith.
>
> -- [Pope Innocent III]() -- [Sermon 4, On the Consecration of a Pontiff (PL 217, 670)]()

St. Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, teaches that "unjust laws of the pope do
not bind in conscience."

> The pope can fall into heresy... Unjust laws of the pope do not bind in conscience...
> The pope is neither the temporal ruler of the world nor the Christian world... he has
> the supreme temporal power only indirectly.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregory Hesse]() -- [On the Limits of Papal Power, (timestamp varies)]()

While the Pope possesses supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the Church, 
this authority is not absolute, arbitrary, or detached from its divine purpose: the salvation 
of souls and the faithful transmission of the Deposit of Faith. 

Papal authority is limited by various laws, as the pope is the "Servor Servorum Fidem", the
server of servants of the Faith:

### Divine Law

The Pope cannot contradict Sacred Scripture or defined Dogma.

> The Holy Ghost was promised to the successors of Peter not so that they might, by
> His revelation, make known some new doctrine, but that, by His assistance, they
> might religiously guard and faithfully expound the revelation or Deposit of Faith
> transmitted by the Apostles.
>
> -- [First Vatican Council, Pastor Aeternus, Ch. 4]() -- [Denzinger 1836 (DS 3070)]()

### Natural Law

The Pope cannot command sin or abrogate the natural moral law.

### The Divine Constitution of the Church

The pope cannot change the essential form of the Church, for example, he cannot
abolish the episcopate.

### Lex Orandi

When Jesus taught the disciples the *Our Father*, can a future pope change that?
No, because the statute of *Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi* holds: What is to be prayed, 
is to be believed. Now, if a pope would try to change the *Our Father*, would it 
make him cease to be pope? No, it's an extremely grave sin against the Faith, but 
his command would simply be invalid.

> If anyone says that the received and approved rites of the Catholic Church, wont
> to be used in the solemn administration of the sacraments, may be contemned, or
> without sin be omitted at pleasure by the ministers, or be changed by any pastor
> of the churches into other new ones: let him be anathema.
>
> -- [Council of Trent, Session VII, Canon 13 on the Sacraments in General]() -- [Denzinger 856 (DS 1613)]()

St. Pius V, in his Bull *Quo Primum Tempore* (1570), codified the immemorial 
Roman Rite, stating it was for perpetual use and that no one whosoever 
(**quiscumque** - absolutely not anyone, including future popes), of whatever rank, 
even papal, could alter it substantially or impose a new one. 

This was not mere disciplinary law but a protection of the *Lex Orandi* which 
is the *Lex Credendi*.

> We determined that this Missal is to be used by all churches... so that they
> should not be obliged to celebrate Mass otherwise than as enjoined by Us... This
> present document cannot be revoked or modified, but remain always valid and retain
> its full force... 
> 
> No one *whosoever (quiscumque)* is permitted to alter this notice of Our
> permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult, declaration,
> will, decree, and prohibition. Should anyone presume to attempt this, let him
> know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles
> Peter and Paul.
>
> -- [Pope St. Pius V, Quo Primum (1570)]() -- []()

Subsequent Popes like Clement VIII and Urban VIII, when making minor revisions,
always added their decrees *to* St. Pius V's, affirming its perennial validity and
stating their work was to restore it from corruptions, not to create something new.
Even John XXIII, for all his modernism, added his decree to this chain.

## Conclusion

We ask our readers: do not fall into the abyss of Papolatry on one side, nor into 
the chasm of private judgment declaring the See vacant on the other. Hold fast to 
Tradition. The Church of Christ will endure, for the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
