Since the early 2000s, secret meetings between groups in the Vatican
and the SSPX worked to slowly make the faithful accept "papal authority"
again, depite that authority working to destroy the Church.

# What is the SSPX Resistance?

In 2012, a seismic event rocked traditional Catholic circles when a significant portion 
of clergy and faithful broke from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) to form what became 
known as "the Resistance." This split represented far more than organizational politics—it 
marked a crucial battle for the preservation of traditional Catholic doctrine. This timeline 
examines how the SSPX gradually moved toward compromise with modernist Rome, culminating 
in the 2012 crisis that forced faithful Catholics to make a difficult choice.

## GREC: 1997-2011

The roots of the 2012 crisis can be traced to the creation of a secretive "think tank" 
in 1997 called GREC (Groupe de Réflexion Entre Catholiques, or "Catholic Reflection Group"). 
While most SSPX faithful remained unaware of its existence until years later, this group 
laid the groundwork for the attempted reconciliation with modernist Rome.

GREC was founded in Rome at the home of Gilbert Pérol, a former French Ambassador to the 
Vatican, and his wife. The four founding members were:

- Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Pérol
- Fr. Michel Lelong (a conciliar priest and fervent defender of interreligious dialogue)
- Fr. Alain Lorans (SSPX spokesman for the District of France)
- Fr. Olivier de La Brosse (spokesman for the Bishops' Conference of France)

From the beginning, GREC's goal was not ambiguous. As explicitly stated in Fr. Lelong's 2011 
book "Towards a Necessary Reconciliation," the purpose was to integrate the SSPX with modernist 
Rome and convince it to accept the Second Vatican Council under the formula of "interpreting 
Vatican II in the light of Tradition" — the very principle that would later be called 
Benedict XVI's "hermeneutic of continuity."

Critically, Fr. Lorans had obtained permission from Bishop Fellay to participate in this 
dialogue "for a necessary reconciliation" and kept him regularly informed of the group's 
activities. Fr. Emmanuel le Chalard of the SSPX also provided "discreet support" to the 
group from its inception.

GREC operated with great discretion, organizing private meetings and colloquia without 
publicity. By 2003, the group had expanded to include other SSPX figures like Fr. Grégoire 
Célier and lay members Jacques-Régis du Cray and Marie-Alix Doutrebente. The apostolic 
nuncios supported this initiative, along with various personalities of the conciliar 
Church who regularly informed the Pope of the dialogue's progress.

GREC's influence became evident when they requested the "lifting of excommunications" of 
the four SSPX bishops as early as the 2000 Jubilee year—a request they would repeat after 
Benedict XVI's election in 2005. By 2010-2011, GREC was actively working toward what they 
hoped would be an "agreement without delay," provided that "the SSPX must stop rejecting 
Vatican II outright and accept the guiding principles in interpreting them as proposed 
by the Holy Father."

This history reveals that Bishop Fellay did not suddenly discover Rome's expectation to 
recognize Vatican II in 2012—this had been clear from the beginning of the SSPX's 
collaboration with GREC, which operated with his knowledge and approval for 15 years 
before the crisis erupted publicly.

## 2012: Signs of Compromise Become Public

By early 2012, what had been happening behind closed doors began to surface publicly. 
Evidence mounted that Bishop Bernard Fellay was pursuing a dangerous path of reconciliation 
with modernist Rome along the lines that GREC had been working toward for years.

In March 2012, Bishop Fellay released a Cor Unum (the SSPX's internal bulletin for priests) 
containing a lengthy explanation of why the SSPX should "rethink our attitude towards Rome." 
This document, not intended for public consumption, revealed the first clear signs of 
doctrinal compromise to the wider SSPX priesthood.

## April 15th: Doctrinal Declaration

The pivotal moment came on April 15, 2012 — symbolically, the 100th anniversary of the 
sinking of the Titanic — when Bishop Fellay signed and submitted the infamous "Doctrinal 
Declaration" to Rome. This document remained hidden from the faithful for nearly a year, 
but its existence and general contents gradually became known through various sources.

Just one day before signing this declaration, the other three SSPX bishops (Williamson, 
Tissier, and De Galarreta) had sent a joint letter to Bishop Fellay urging him to cease 
negotiations with Rome. Bishop Fellay disregarded their concerns and proceeded anyway, 
responding with an emotional letter co-signed by his two assistants that defenders of 
tradition described as "wishy-washy, flip-flop, modernist" rhetoric.

### Contents of the Doctrinal Declaration

When finally revealed in early 2013, the Doctrinal Declaration proved to be a profound 
betrayal of Archbishop Lefebvre's position. Among its most problematic elements:

1. It explicitly accepted Vatican II's teaching on collegiality, stating: "We declare that we accept the doctrine regarding the Roman Pontiff and regarding the college of bishops, with the Pope as its head..."

2. It embraced modernist language about Tradition, declaring that "Tradition progresses in the Church" — a phrase lifted directly from Vatican II's Dei Verbum document.

3. Perhaps most alarmingly, it stated that Vatican II "enlightens - in other words deepens and subsequently makes explicit - certain aspects of the life and doctrine of the Church." This positioned Vatican II as a positive development that "deepens" Catholic teaching rather than contradicting it.

4. It required the acceptance of Benedict XVI's "hermeneutic of continuity," insisting that Vatican II's teachings on religious liberty and ecumenism "must be understood in the light of the whole, uninterrupted Tradition, in a manner coherent with the truths previously taught by the Magisterium of the Church, without accepting any interpretation of these affirmations whatsoever that would expose Catholic doctrine to opposition or rupture with Tradition..."

5. It recognized the validity of the New Mass as "legitimately promulgated by Popes Paul VI and John-Paul II." This single word "legitimately" (which Archbishop Lefebvre had explicitly rejected in a similar 1988 protocol) effectively surrendered the SSPX's entire position on the liturgical revolution.

6. It pledged respect for "the common discipline of the Church and the ecclesiastical laws, especially those which are contained in the Code of Canon Law promulgated by John-Paul II (1983)."

Tellingly, after Rome received the declaration, they edited it to make it 
even more explicitly modernist. When Bishop Fellay saw these changes, he wrote 
to Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the revised text would not "get past" 
the faithful — inadvertently revealing that his original text was deliberately 
crafted to be ambiguous enough to slip by without causing too much revolt.

## Public Revelation and Resistance

Throughout April and May 2012, Bishop Fellay gave numerous interviews where he 
made alarming statements, including:

- "Religious liberty is very, very limited"
- "Vatican II isn't as bad as we thought"
- "Benedict XVI has changed"

These statements directly contradicted Archbishop Lefebvre's clear positions. 
The Catholic News Service (CNS) interview was particularly damning, showing Bishop 
Fellay making excuses for Vatican II and minimizing its errors.

In response, faithful Catholics around the world began to mobilize. In England alone, 
hundreds of SSPX faithful signed a letter of protest to Bishop Fellay. Similar 
reactions occurred worldwide, with unprecedented numbers of priests openly 
criticizing the new direction from the pulpit.

## July 2012 General Chapter

The SSPX General Chapter met in July 2012, providing an opportunity to correct 
course. Instead, they betrayed their duty by endorsing Bishop Fellay's new 
direction. They issued a statement with "six conditions" for an agreement 
with Rome—three deemed "essential" and three merely "desirable"—signaling 
their willingness to compromise on critical matters.

This represented a complete reversal from the 2006 General Chapter, which 
had explicitly rejected any "purely practical agreement" with Rome until 
modernist errors were abandoned. The 2012 Chapter effectively threw this 
principle away, betraying Archbishop Lefebvre's clear position.

## October 2012: Bishop Williamson Expelled

In October 2012, Bishop Richard Williamson was expelled from the SSPX, 
largely for his opposition to the new direction. This heavy-handed action 
further demonstrated the leadership's determination to silence opposition 
to their modernist drift.

## March 2013: The Declaration Revealed

The text of the Doctrinal Declaration was finally made public in early 2013 — 
and only because a resistance priest (Fr. Olivier Rieux) obtained it and 
announced his intention to publish it, forcing the SSPX's hand.

The document proved even worse than feared, containing all the compromises 
detailed above and effectively nullifying the entire reason for the SSPX's existence.

## May/June 2013: The Resistance Forms

The final break came in late May/early June 2013, when traditional priests 
including Fathers Pfeiffer, Chazal, and Hewko held a conference to determine a 
path forward. By the end of this two-day gathering, they concluded they could 
no longer remain in the SSPX and needed to establish an alternative to 
preserve authentic Catholic tradition.

## Why This Matters: Doctrine Above All

The significance of these events cannot be overstated. As Catholics, we 
understand that doctrine is everything—it is the foundation upon which all else 
is built. Faith gives us hope, and faith and hope give us charity. Scripture 
tells us that without faith, it is impossible to please God.

When Bishop Fellay signed the Doctrinal Declaration, he wasn't merely making an 
administrative decision—he was compromising the very faith that Archbishop 
Lefebvre had fought to preserve. As Fr. Ludovic Barrielle (highly revered 
by Archbishop Lefebvre) presciently warned in 1982:

> The day that the SSPX abandons the spirit and rules of its Founder, it will 
> be lost. Furthermore, all our brothers who, in the future, allow themselves 
> to judge and condemn the Founder and his principles, will show no hesitation 
> in eventually taking away from the Society the traditional teaching of the 
> Church and the Mass instituted by Our Lord Jesus Christ.
>

The Resistance emerged not as rebels, but as the true inheritors of Archbishop 
Lefebvre's work. While the SSPX leadership betrayed their founder's mission 
through compromise, the Resistance maintained his unwavering stance against modernism.
