# Does communion need wine?

Orthodox Christians (as well as Luther) criticize the historic Roman Catholic practice of withholding 
the chalice from the laity during Holy Communion, offering them only the consecrated bread. They point 
to Christ's command "Drink all of you from it" (Matthew 26:27) and argue that receiving both forms 
is necessary for full participation in the Eucharist. This practice, Orthodox and Protestant theologians 
maintain, contradicts the apostolic tradition preserved in the Eastern Church.

## Refutation

In "Contra Errores Graecorum," St. Thomas Aquinas addresses this liturgical difference by examining 
the theological principles underlying Eucharistic practice in both traditions.

> "Lay Participation in the Mystery of Communion"

While Aquinas acknowledges the historical practice of communion under both kinds in the early Church, 
he explains why the Western practice developed as it did. He notes that Christ is fully present—body, 
blood, soul, and divinity—under either form, as St. Paul implies when he writes:

> "Whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of profaning the 
> body and blood of the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Thomas recognizes legitimate reasons why the Eastern tradition maintained communion under 
both kinds. St. Cyril of Jerusalem taught:

> "After having thus become partakers of the Body of Christ, approach also the Cup of His Blood; not 
> stretching forth thine hands, but bending and saying in the way of worship and reverence, 'Amen,' 
> be thou hallowed by partaking also of the Blood of Christ."

However, Aquinas defends the Western practice as a prudential development that arose from practical 
concerns: the risk of spilling the Precious Blood, difficulties in administering the chalice to 
large congregations, and the need to counter certain heresies that denied Christ's complete 
presence under either form alone.

Importantly, Thomas does not present this as a matter of dogma but of discipline, which can vary 
according to the needs of the Church in different times and places. He would point out that the 
essence of the sacrament is preserved as long as it is celebrated with bread and wine, and both 
forms are consumed at least by the celebrant.

The Catholic Church has since revised its practice, allowing more frequent reception of communion 
under both kinds while maintaining that the fullness of Christ is received under either form alone. 
This development shows the Church's ability to adapt liturgical practice while preserving essential 
doctrine.

## Conclusion

While acknowledging the legitimacy of the Orthodox practice of offering communion under both forms, 
Aquinas would maintain that the historic Western practice was not a fundamental error but a disciplinary 
adaptation that preserved the essence of the sacrament.
