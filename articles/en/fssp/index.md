The FSSP is in "full communion" with the Pope, has seemingly the full support 
of the Vatican and celebrates the Latin Mass - so what's wrong with their 
approach? Why not just try to reform the Church from the inside instead 
of risking a schism?

# What about the FSSP, ICKSP, Indult Mass?

In traditional Catholic circles, one of the most divisive questions concerns the 
relationship between the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) / SSPX Resistance and the 
various "Ecclesia Dei" communities such as the Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP) and 
the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP) as well as other groups 
being permitted to celebrate the Latin Mass while being in "full communion" with the Pope. 
While all celebrate the Traditional Latin Mass, their relationship with Rome and their 
stance on Vatican II create an unbridgeable gap that many faithful Catholics 
fail to understand.

## Not Just Liturgy

The division doesn't stem merely from liturgical preferences but from fundamental 
questions about the Faith itself. As Fr. Hesse explains:

> The reason why I cannot obey the pope is because I'm bound to the divine law, 
> and the new rite is against the divine law. Therefore, I'm not allowed to 
> celebrate it. I commit a sin if I celebrate it.
>
> -- [Hesse, G.: On the SSPX, FSSP, ICKSP and sedevacantists]()

This position—that the Novus Ordo Mass is contrary to divine law—stands in stark 
contrast to the position required of Ecclesia Dei groups, who must acknowledge 
the legitimacy of the new Mass as a condition for their canonical recognition.

## Archbishop Lefebvre's Stand

Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre clearly foresaw the dangers of compromise. In his 
famous 1974 Declaration, he stated:

> We hold fast, with all our heart and with all our soul, to Catholic Rome, 
> Guardian of the Catholic Faith and of the traditions necessary to preserve 
> this faith, to Eternal Rome, Mistress of wisdom and truth.
>
> We refuse, on the other hand, and have always refused to follow the Rome of 
> neo-Modernist and neo-Protestant tendencies which were clearly evident in the 
> Second Vatican Council and, after the Council, in all the reforms which issued from it.
>
> -- [Lefevbre, M., Declaration of November 21, 1974]()

Later, when faced with the critical decision to consecrate bishops without papal 
approval in 1988, Lefebvre wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger:

> Upon reflection, it appears clear that the goal of these dialogues is to 
> reabsorb us within the Conciliar Church, the only Church to which you make 
> allusion during these meetings. We hoped that you would give us the means 
> to continue and develop the works of Tradition... Now on these two points, 
> which we deem necessary to maintain our works outside of all progressivist 
> and conciliar influence, we are not satisfied...
>
> -- [Letter to Cdl. Ratzinger on May 24, 1988]()

His letter to Pope John Paul II on June 2, 1988, just weeks before the 
consecrations, was even more explicit:

> It is to keep the Faith of our Baptism intact that we have had to resist the 
> spirit of Vatican II and the reforms inspired by it... Being radically opposed 
> to this destruction of our Faith and determined to remain with the traditional 
> doctrine and discipline of the Church... we find ourselves in the absolute 
> necessity of having ecclesiastical authorities who embrace our concerns and 
> will help us to protect ourselves against the spirit of Vatican II and the 
> spirit of Assisi.
>
> -- [Letter to Pope John Paul II, June 2, 1988]()

## FSSP: Created to trap Traditionalists

The FSSP was created immediately after Archbishop Lefebvre's 1988 episcopal 
consecrations, not out of Rome's sudden appreciation for tradition, but as a 
strategic move to undermine the SSPX. As Bishop Williamson noted in his 
December 1999 letter:

> Conciliar Rome welcomed them with open arms. Because it had converted to 
> Tridentinism? Of course not. Rather, it saw in these refugees from the 
> Society of St. Plus X an opportunity to set up under Rome's control an 
> alternative 'Traditional' movement to keep souls away from the real Traditional 
> movement henceforth 'excommunicated' and so out of Rome's control...
>
> -- [Bishop Williamson: Letter of December 1999]()

This assessment was confirmed by Archbishop Gänswein, who revealed 
Benedict XVI's intentions regarding Summorum Pontificum:

> I believe that Pope Benedict read this motu proprio with pain in his heart b
> ecause he wished to help those who wanted to find inner peace, also the 
> liturgical peace, and to get them away from [Archbishop Marcel] Lefebvre.
>
> -- [Gänswein interview with Die Tagespost, January 2023]()

## The Fundamental Compromise

The FSSP and similar groups made a fatal compromise at their very foundation. 
As the SSPX officially explained:

> The Fraternity of St. Peter is founded upon more than questionable principles... 
> It accepts that the Conciliar Church has the power: to take away the Mass of all time, 
> to grant it to those only who accept the same Conciliar Church's novel orientations, 
> to declare non-Catholic those who deny this by word or deed...
>
> -- [SSPX Archives: What are we to think of the Fraternity of St. Peter?]()

Fr. Peter Scott, former SSPX District Superior, identified the heart of the matter 
in his August 2000 letter:

> The Cardinal President of the Commission [Ecclesia Dei] then went on to explain to 
> the Fraternity's members why he was obliging the appointment of a new Superior General, 
> and new Seminary Rectors and faculty, all of a liberal tendency, of a mind to accept 
> and promote the New Mass and to be integrated into the post-Conciliar church.
>
> -- [Fr. Scott: Letter to Friends and Benefactors, August 2000]()

Fr. Hesse further emphasizes the difference between the SSPX and Ecclesia Dei groups:

> The Fraternity of Saint Peter officially agrees with Vatican II, and officially agrees 
> with the present pope's encyclicals. So they are not Catholics, officially, objectively. 
> They are formally not Catholics. Formally. In their heart, I don't know. I have friends 
> in the Fraternity of Saint Peter who are good priests, but, uh, formally, they're not 
> Catholics. Formally, they're in heresy because they sign and affirm, officially, formally, 
> objectively, heresy, which means Vatican II.
>
> -- [Hesse, G.: On the SSPX, FSSP, ICKSP and sedevacantists]()

## Outside the Official Structures

From the perspective of the SSPX and those who hold to Archbishop Lefebvre's position, 
operating outside the official structures becomes not just preferable but necessary 
when those structures enforce adherence to error.

The essential point is that one cannot simultaneously preserve the Faith in its entirety 
and accept the authority of those who undermine it. Bishop Williamson puts it plainly:

> The direction being taken by Rome is clear as clear can be... 
> If one wishes to organize the defense of the Catholic faith, there is, alas, 
> only the Archbishop's way. One cannot put oneself under these neo-modernist Romans.
>
> -- [Bishop R.Williamson: Letter of December 1999]()

## Conclusion

For faithful Catholics who recognize the crisis in the Church, the question is not 
one of disobedience versus obedience, but rather obedience to what and to whom. 
Archbishop Lefebvre maintained that obedience to the eternal Rome—to the Faith 
handed down through the centuries—takes precedence over obedience to the modernist 
orientation that has taken hold since Vatican II.

As the Archbishop famously stated:

> The only attitude of faithfulness to the Church and Catholic doctrine, 
> in view of our salvation, is a categorical refusal to accept this Reformation.
>
> -- [Declaration of November 21, 1974]()

This remains the position of the SSPX today. While charitable toward individual 
members of Ecclesia Dei communities and recognizing their good intentions, the 
Society cannot accept the compromised foundation upon which these communities are built.
