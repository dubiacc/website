The FSSP is in "full communion" with the Pope, has seemingly the full support
of the Vatican and celebrates the Latin Mass - so what's wrong with their
approach? Why not just try to reform the Church from the inside instead
of risking a schism?

# FSSP: Betrayal of Faith in exchange for "full communion"

In traditional Catholic circles, it is often not understood that the "schism" 
between the Novus Ordo and the Latin Mass isn't just about the Mass; it's 
about the Faith itself. As nobody can please God without having the Catholic Faith 
(Hebrews 11:6) or go to heaven without the faith, maintaining the purity of the faith
is of supreme importance. 

But what actually *is* the Catholic Church? It is the body of people holding 
the Catholic Faith. But what is the Catholic Faith? It is nothing else than the 
tradition of the Church, passed down from the apostles and their successors. So,
if a pope directly contradicts tradition in matters of faith, are we bound to 
obey him? Should we be scared of such a person excommunicating us? 

The question of groups like the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP), the Institute 
of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP), and other "Ecclesia Dei" communities cuts 
to the very heart of what it means to be Catholic. While they offer the Traditional 
Latin Mass, their "full communion" (a term invented by the modernist pope Benedict XVI)
with post-Conciliar Rome is built on a catastrophic compromise: the acceptance of 
Vatican II's doctrinal deviations in exchange to keep the marble altars and nice churches. 

This isn't a mere disagreement on strategy between the FSSP / SSPX / Resistance: it's 
a battle for the soul of Catholicism, the Catholic faith.

## Vatican II's Man-Centered Heresy

The core heresy of Vatican II, the poison that infects its documents, is the elevation 
of man to the place of God. Consider the infamous line from *Gaudium et Spes* 12: 

> According to the almost unanimous opinion of **believers** and unbelievers alike, 
> all things on earth should be related to **man** as their center and crown.
>
> -- [Gaudium et Spes, 12](https://archive.is/jI78Q#selection-417.4-417.153)

A Catholic cannot sign this document. Everything on earth should have **God** at its 
center and goal, not man! Many people have invented marvelously creative ways to try 
to weasel their way out of calling it "heresy", trying to call it a "seeming contradiction",
to "understand it in the light of Tradition", to "engage in dialectic", to build a 
"hermeneutic of continuity". 

This is the rotten fruit of Vatican II's new philosophy: "Man is made in the image of God, 
therefore we will celebrate man, and as a result celebrate God." This insidious inversion 
places the worship of Gods glory second, a mere byproduct of man's glory. "But", say the 
modernists, "we do celebrate the glory of God - inside of man!" Such nonsense is the very 
essence of modernism. 

Priests who, under the guise of obedience, endorse such statements are not shepherds; 
they are, at best, misguided, and at worst, traitors to the Faith, like Judas, selling 
out Truth for a marble altar.

Many are quick to condemn the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) or the Resistance, claiming 
"there is no salvation in the SSPX". While an easy polemic adaption of "Outside of the 
Church there is no Salvation", we have to look at "Who belongs to the Catholic Church?".

What is certain, is that there is no salvation for people who knowingly sign off on heresy. 
This applies directly to priests of the FSSP, ICKSP, and any who operate under the banner 
of "Ecclesia Dei" or celebrate the Novus Ordo Missae while endorsing the Council that 
birthed its errors.

> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot. I would thou wert cold, or hot.
> But because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold, nor hot, I will begin to vomit thee 
> out of my mouth.
>
> -- [Revelation 3:15-16](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=73&ch=3&l=16#x)

## Faith Before Communion with Traitors

Obedience to the Pope is vital, but that obedience is only when it **serves** the faith,
not when it directly contradicts it. It comes **after** fidelity to doctrine and the 
True Mass (which simply expresses the faith).

> But what is the Pope? What is the Vatican? What is the Holy See? What are they?
>
> Why did Our Lord Jesus Christ institute Saint Peter as the head of the Church? 
> What did He require of Saint Peter? - "Keep the faith, and keep it for the others." 
> And the Vatican which is nothing else but the residence of the successor of the apostles 
> is not destined for any other purpose. 
> 
> The Holy Roman Church is the mother and mistress of all truth: Mater et Magistra omnium 
> ecclesiarum magistra veritatis. And if is just that for which we ask. At our baptism we 
> asked for it from the Church. Our godparents asked for it in our name when we were carried 
> to the baptismal font. 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> "What do you ask of the Church of God?" That was the question the priest put 
> to our godparents: What do you ask of the Church of God? We ask for faith. That 
> was what our godparents answered. And now we too ask from the Church, or from 
> those who say they are of the Church, those occupying important posts in the Church, 
> those responsible for that faith - we ask them: "Preserve the Faith for us, 
> give us the Faith. That Catholic Faith is what we want. We want no other.”
>
> "Why do you ask for Faith?", the priest said to our godparents. "We want Faith 
> because Faith brings us to Eternal Life."
>
> Why are we here below unless to gain Eternal Life? We have no other purpose here 
> below except to gain Eternal Life; life on earth is a fleeting life, an ephemeral 
> life-a few days, few years, a few decades. We have to choose if we want Eternal Life - 
> Yes or No. We want Eternal Life, and for that we want the Catholic Faith. But we are 
> compelled to state that for fifteen or twenty years those with the highest authority 
> in the Church, the Holy See and the Vatican, have been turning away, turning us 
> away from the Catholic Faith and have become the friends of our enemies.
> 
> -- [Archbishop Lefevbre: Sermon of the 1988 Consecrations]()

Being "outside of the Catholic Church" therefore doesn't mean to be excommunicated from 
people who believes that man should be the center of everything: because such an excommunication
is nothing but an abuse of power directed at those who put God first. Effectively, the
accusation of "excommunication" is nothing else as what the Jews told St. Peter:

> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest 
> asked them, saying: Commanding we commanded you, that you should not teach in this name; 
> and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you have a mind to bring the 
> blood of this man (note: Jesus) upon us.
> 
> But Peter and the apostles answering, said: We ought to obey God, rather than men.
>
> -- [Acts 5:27-29](https://www.drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?q=acts+5%3A27-29&x=0&y=0&b=drb&t=0)

So, dear reader, when you stand before God, will you say, "I did not sign off on heresy," 
or will you plead, "I obeyed the pope, even when he led us astray"?

> I no longer understand it. I no longer understand it! This is not our Church! 
> This is no longer our Catholic Church! It is no longer our Catholic Faith. I want 
> to be and to stay Catholic. So why am I required to suppress our seminary? Why am 
> I required to suppress our Sacerdotal Fraternity of Saint Pius X? Why am I required 
> not to perform these ordinations? 
> 
> There is only one reason: to bring me into line with this policy. They want me to 
> lend a hand in this destruction of the Church, to join in this communion which, 
> for the Church is adultery. 
> 
> I will not be an adulterer. I will keep my Catholic Faith!
>
> -- [Archbishop Lefevbre: Sermon of the 1988 Consecrations]()

## The Novus Ordo: Fruit of a Poisoned Tree

The Novus Ordo Mass is not an isolated liturgical aberration. It is the direct, 
logical, and inevitable liturgical expression of this new, man-centered "faith" spawned 
by Vatican II. 

> The reason why I cannot obey the pope is because I'm bound to the Divine Law,
> and the New Rite is against the Divine Law. Therefore, I'm not allowed to
> celebrate it. I commit a sin if I celebrate it.
>
> -- [Hesse, G.: On the SSPX, FSSP, ICKSP and sedevacantists]()

The New Mass, designed with the explicit intention of appealing to Protestants, necessarily 
waters down or excises Catholic doctrine, particularly concerning the sacrificial nature of 
the Mass. It is a liturgy for a church that has made man its focus.

## Archbishop Lefebvre's Uncompromising Stand

Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre saw this apostasy unfolding and refused to be a part of it. 
His 1974 Declaration was a line in the sand:

> We hold fast, with all our heart and with all our soul, to Catholic Rome,
> Guardian of the Catholic Faith and of the traditions necessary to preserve
> this faith, to Eternal Rome, Mistress of wisdom and truth.
>
> We refuse, on the other hand, and have always refused to follow the Rome of
> neo-Modernist and neo-Protestant tendencies which were clearly evident in the
> Second Vatican Council and, after the Council, in all the reforms which issued from it.
>
> -- [Lefevbre, M., Declaration of November 21, 1974]()

His decision to consecrate bishops in 1988, an act of sheer necessity, was born from 
the realization that dialogue with modernist Rome was a trap:

> Upon reflection, it appears clear that the goal of these dialogues is to
> reabsorb us within the Conciliar Church... we find ourselves in the absolute
> necessity of having ecclesiastical authorities who embrace our concerns and
> will help us to protect ourselves against the spirit of Vatican II and the
> spirit of Assisi.
>
> -- [Letter to Pope John Paul II, June 2, 1988]()

The same story be told about the Resistance: After the SSPX had to resist Rome, 
Bishop Williamsons decision to consecrate bishops was the same in 2015 - 2021: 
as neither Pope Francis or Pope Benedict condemned the errors of Vatican II and 
restored order in the Church: God first, man second - but instead they doubled 
down on it with a lot of elaborate or less elaborate dialectic.

## FSSP: Controlled Opposition and Fatal Compromise

The FSSP was not born from Rome's love for Tradition but from its desire to neutralize 
it. As Bishop Williamson bluntly stated, the FSSP became an opportunity for Conciliar Rome:

> To set up under Rome's control an alternative 'Traditional' movement 
> to keep souls away from the real Traditional movement henceforth 
> 'excommunicated' and so out of Rome's control...
>
> -- [Bishop Williamson: Letter of December 1999]()

This is not conspiracy; it's strategy. Archbishop Gänswein confirmed Benedict XVI's motive 
for *Summorum Pontificum* being "to get them away from [Archbishop Marcel] Lefebvre." 

Without the SSPX, there would be no FSSP. The FSSP exists as **controlled opposition**, designed 
to offer a veneer of tradition while ensuring loyalty to the Conciliar revolution, lest people 
get "too radical" by actually holding firm to the entirety of the Faith, without compromise under 
the guise of false obedience.

The FSSP and its ilk made a **fatal compromise**: they accepted Vatican II and the legitimacy 
of the New Mass. This means they implicitly accept the man-centered heresies that underpin them. 
Fr. Peter Scott pointed out how the FSSP was forced to accept liberal leadership "of a mind to 
accept and promote the New Mass and to be integrated into the post-Conciliar church."

> The Fraternity of Saint Peter officially agrees with Vatican II, and officially agrees
> with the present pope's encyclicals. So **they are not Catholics, officially, objectively**.
> They are formally not Catholics... **Formally, they're in heresy** because they sign and 
> affirm, officially, formally, objectively, heresy, which means Vatican II.
>
> -- [Hesse, G.: On the SSPX, FSSP, ICKSP and sedevacantists]()

This also explains why this site does not link to Latin Masses "in communion"
with the modernist popes: Because all these communities (and there are lots of them),
had to sign an agreement of either silence in order to get recognition from modernist Rome.

## The Real Question of Salvation

Now, might one ask, is there "no salvation outside the Resistance"? While The 
terrifying, real question is: Is there salvation for those who, for the sake of 
"regularization" or "obedience" to compromised authorities, sign off on or remain 
silent about heresies that place man at the center instead of God? Will God in his 
final judgement be pleased with that and allow these people, or anyone who stays 
silent, entry to heaven?

Who will get to heaven: those "in communion" with a hierarchy that has betrayed the 
Faith, remained silent or even promoted error, or those who, though perhaps temporarily 
"outside the Church's structures," fight to maintain the unadulterated doctrine 
of Christ? May the reader discern wisely.

Operating outside compromised official structures becomes a **sacred duty** when 
those structures demand adherence to error or silence in the face of it. One cannot 
serve two masters: the unchanging Christ and the ever-changing fads of Modernist Rome.

## Conclusion

The divide is not about liturgy alone; it is about the very substance of the Catholic Faith.
It is a choice between the Eternal Rome of the Apostles, Martyrs, and Saints, and the 
Neo-Modernist Rome that worships at the altar of man. Archbishop Lefebvre's stance was clear: 
obedience to God and His immutable Truth comes before obedience to men who betray that Truth.

> The only attitude of faithfulness to the Church and Catholic doctrine,
> in view of our salvation, is a categorical refusal to accept this Reformation.
>
> -- [Declaration of November 21, 1974]()

This is not a path of disobedience but of supreme obedience to Christ the King. Those who 
choose the FSSP, ICKSP, or any "Ecclesia Dei" group, believing they can reform from within 
while accepting the Conciliar premises, are deluding themselves. 

They have swallowed the poison pill of Vatican II in exchange for a Potemkin village of 
tradition. The true fight for the Faith requires courage, clarity, and an unwillingness 
to compromise with the revolution that seeks to destroy it. I care about saying and teaching 
the truth, even if I have to be labeled "disobedient," "schismatic," and whatnot. 

If the FSSP truly stood for tradition, they would be standing with those who resist, 
not appeasing those who dismantle. What they do stand for are marble altars and incense.

And this is why we, the dubia.cc editorial team, cannot recommend people to attend the Masses 
of the FSSP / ICKSP or the Novus Ordo, not even for pastoral reasons: If the goal of attending
a Mass is to get sanctifying grace from God, being at an adulterous FSSP Mass is a waste of time.
