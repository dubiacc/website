# The Novus Ordo Mass: An Obligation for Traditional Catholics?

For traditional Catholics, the question of attending the Novus Ordo Mass (NOM)
is not merely one of preference but of fidelity to the unchanging Catholic Faith.
This article explores compelling reasons why attendance is not only unadvisable
but spiritually perilous.

## 1. A Rite of Questionable Promulgation

Fr. Gregorius Hesse argued that the Novus Ordo Missae was *published* by Paul VI,
but never "validly" promulgated in a way that would bind the entire Church
in perpetuity, as was the Traditional Latin Mass by Pope St. Pius V's *Quo Primum*.

> Pope Paul VI signed that and Pope Paul VI said he likes the book
> and he adds three Eucharistic prayers to the already existing Canon of
> the Mass. 
> 
> So Paul VI never said that I *have* to use the new Missal, it was the 
> congregation who said so, but the congregation cannot decide something 
> behind the back of the pope even if the pope afterwards silently agrees.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregorius Hesse]() -- [Padre Hesse #04 - Os Problemas da Missa Nova]()

This suggests a lack of the full weight of infallible papal authority typically
associated with such a significant liturgical change, perhaps an instance where
the Holy Spirit did not permit an irrevocable binding of the Church to a new rite.

## 2. Doubtful Validity: A Meal or a Sacrifice?

A core issue is the NOM's ambiguous presentation of the Mass. Is it primarily
the unbloody re-presentation of Christ's sacrifice on Calvary, or is it a
communal meal? This doubt strikes at the heart of the celebrant's intention.

> The definition of mass given by the way in the Roman Missal of 1969 and
> 1970 [...] is the following: "The mass or the Supper of Our Lord is
> when people come together and unite under Christ to give praise and
> Thanksgiving to him." 
> 
> Now that's the definition of the Roman missile. Where's the sacrifice for 
> the forgiving of sins? Where's the propitiatory sacrifice? Where's the 
> Real Presence?
>
> -- [Fr. Gregorius Hesse]() -- [Padre Hesse #04 - Os Problemas da Missa Nova]()

This shift in emphasis, away from the propitiatory sacrifice, introduces a
grave doubt regarding the correct intention required for a valid consecration.

## 3. A Schismatic Rite, Not the Latin Rite

Fr. Hesse forcefully contended that the Novus Ordo is not merely a reformed
version of the traditional Latin Rite, but a new, schismatic rite, largely
devised by Annibale Bugnini with Protestant input.

> I say that the Novus Ordo of Mass published by Pope Paul VI [...]
> is not the Latin Roman rite, but is a schismatic rite. [...]
> If it's not the Latin Roman rite, but a schismatic rite,
> you cannot apply Pope Pius XII's decree, *Sacramentum Ordinis*, to
> examine its validity. You will have to examine the validity of the Novus
> Ordo rite the same way the church has always examined the validity of
> schismatic rites. [...] The last one to go into a thorough examination
> of schismatic rites was Pope Leo XIII in [...] 1894 in his decree,
> *Apostolicae Curae*, in which he decides that Anglican orders are not valid.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregorius Hesse]() -- [The_Problems_of_the_Novus_Ordo_Sacraments.srt]()

This perspective demands an evaluation based on principles used for rites
outside the continuous tradition of the Roman Rite.

## 4. A Priesthood and Episcopate of Doubtful Validity

The liturgical revolution extended to the rites of Ordination and Episcopal
Consecration. Comparing the old and new rites reveals severe omissions and
alterations that cast doubt on the validity of Holy Orders conferred using them.

> The novelty and danger of the new rite consists especially in the
> abolition of the two ceremonies by which the bishop clearly explains
> the powers of the Catholic priest:
> 
> 1) In relation to the power to offer Mass: 
> 
> [Old Rite:] *“Receive the power to offer the Sacrifice to God and to celebrate Masses for the living and the dead.”* 
> 
> [New Rite]: changes this, omitting "and the dead" and altering the direct conferral of power.
> 
> 2) In relation to the power to hear confession: 
> 
> [Old Rite:] The second imposition of hands along with a quote of Our Lord imself: 
> *“Receive the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, 
> and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.”* (John 20:22) 
> 
> [New Rite:] Abolished completely.
>
> -- [SSPXAsia]() -- [Priestly Ordination: The New Rite Vs. The Old Rite]()

Similarly, the new rite of Episcopal Consecration is plagued by ambiguities.
For example, regarding the form:

> In the New Rite's prayer of consecration for a bishop, it does not
> mention the power of orders. In fact, it doesn't mention the
> priesthood at all! 
> 
> [...] 
> 
> Nothing in this part mentions or asks for the full power of the priesthood 
> or the grace of the Holy Ghost as Pope Pius XII declares as *absolutely necessary*.
>
> -- [Comparison of Old and New Episcopal Consecration Rites, p. 25]()

While individual ordinations *might* be valid if performed by a validly
consecrated bishop *with correct intention* and the new book, the rite *itself*
is deficient. 

When eternal salvation is at stake, there cannot be a shred of
doubt about the validity of the sacraments and their ministers.

## 5. If a Sacrament is Doubtful, Stay Away

Church teaching and prudence dictate that Catholics must avoid doubtful
sacraments.

> We cannot and must not approach doubtful sacraments.
>
> -- Fr. Gregorius Hesse, "[The_Problems_of_the_Novus_Ordo_Sacraments.srt]"
> (referencing Blessed Innocent XI's condemnation of probabilism in
> sacramental practice, Denzinger-Schönmetzer 2101)

This principle alone is a strong reason to abstain from the Novus Ordo.

## 6. A Rite Not Expressing the Catholic Faith

The Novus Ordo, particularly in its vernacular translations, often fails to
express the fullness of Catholic doctrine and, in some instances, appears to
contradict it. The change from "pro multis" (for many) to "for all" in the
words of consecration is a prime example.

> In the Roman Missal, in *De Defectibus*, it says so. [...]
> 
> "If the celebrant was to be distracted or interrupted at the words of
> consecration, and if these shortened or changed words of consecration
> contain a change of significance, and if the celebrant does not repeat
> the words of consecration fully and correctly, the sacrament does not
> take place." 
> 
> Now to change "for the many" to "for all," as you can easily see, 
> is a change in significance.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregorius Hesse]() -- [The_Problems_of_the_Novus_Ordo_Sacraments.srt]()

If the rite itself does not clearly signify what the Church does, its Catholicity
is questionable.

## 7. St. Thomas Aquinas on Sinful or Heretical Ministers

St. Thomas Aquinas, in the *Summa Theologica*, addresses whether one may receive
Communion from or hear Mass said by heretical, schismatic, or excommunicated
priests:

> heretical, schismatical, excommunicate, or even sinful priests,
> although they have the power to consecrate the Eucharist, yet they do
> not make a proper use of it; on the contrary, they sin by using it.
> 
> But whoever communicates with another who is in sin, 
> **becomes a sharer in his sin.** [...] Consequently, it is not 
> lawful to receive Communion from them, or to assist at their mass.
>
> -- [St. Thomas Aquinas]() -- [Summa Theologica, TP, Q82, A9]()

While St. Thomas allows for receiving from a sinful priest *not yet sentenced by
the Church*, the argument for traditional Catholics is that many Novus Ordo clergy,
by their adherence to Vatican II's novelties, effectively align themselves with
a departure from Catholic Tradition, making their ministry spiritually unsafe.

> Moreover, the sacraments in the NO are highly doubtful (if the
> priests themselves do not believe in the Eucharist, they naturally
> cannot confect it - because they do not have the intention of the Church
> at all).

## 8. Spiritual Danger: Tempting God

To willingly place oneself in spiritual danger by attending a rite that is
doubtful, or celebrated by those with questionable faith or intention, is not
a virtue but can be seen as tempting God.

> I do not go to the NO (there is no obligation to go to a Mass where
> one deliberately puts oneself in spiritual danger, unfortunately, most
> people do not know this and think they are obliged to listen to complete
> rubbish on Sundays).

## 9. The Goal of Sunday Sanctification

The purpose of sanctifying Sunday is to receive God's grace by doing His will
and offering Him true worship.

> The goal of Mass on Sunday is not a "duty" without meaning, but the
> goal is to receive the sanctifying grace of God by doing His will.

A liturgy that is objectively displeasing to God, due to its departures from
Tradition and its doctrinal ambiguities, cannot be the primary means of
fulfilling this obligation if a traditional Mass is accessible.

## 10. Grace Reduced or Nullified

Even if one were to concede the theoretical validity of a given Novus Ordo Mass
(*ex opere operato*), the surrounding liturgical laxity, scandals, and the general
atmosphere often diminish or nullify the grace (*ex opere operantis*) that the
faithful might otherwise receive. The dispositions of both the minister and the
recipient are crucial for the fruitful reception of grace.

## 11. Stepping on Jesus

The widespread practice of Communion in the hand in Novus Ordo churches leads to
a horrifying reality:

> Additionally, in NO churches, crumbs of Jesus are lying around
> everywhere (Communion in the hand) and I would accidentally step on
> Jesus if I went there. Heaven, no.

This manifest disrespect for the Blessed Sacrament is a grave scandal and a
danger to souls.

## 12. The Root: A Blasphemous, Man-Centered Philosophy

Ultimately, the problems with the Novus Ordo Mass stem from the flawed,
man-centered philosophy of Vatican II itself.

> Now, how about such a statement as, "Believers and non-believers 
> unanimously agree that all the efforts of mankind are directed 
> towards man as its center and summit." - That's blasphemy. 
> 
> Gaudium et Spes Number 12.
>
> -- [Fr. Gregorius Hesse]() -- [The_Problems_of_the_Novus_Ordo_Sacraments.srt]()

When man, rather than God, becomes the focus of the Church's liturgy and
theology, such deviations are inevitable.

## Conclusion: Choosing Fidelity

Given the grave doubts about its promulgation, validity, the expression of
Catholic doctrine, the spiritual danger it poses, and the questionable status
of its clergy's formation, traditional Catholics have strong theological and
pastoral reasons to abstain from the Novus Ordo Mass. 

The obligation to keep Sunday holy is best fulfilled by seeking out the 
Traditional Latin Mass from a priest that is not putting you in spiritual danger
and uncompromisingly preaches about the full Catholic Faith - [see this map](/resistance),
as this undoubtedly offers true worship and sanctifying grace. 

If this is unavailable, it is far more pleasing to God to sanctify the Sunday 
by praying the Mass yourself (except for the sentences that a layman cannot say), 
see the [/missa](/missa) folder for a nicely-formatted list of Mass prayers for
every Sunday of the year, or [divinumofficium.com](https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/missa/missa.pl)
for an online Missal with original texts (click "Sancta Missa" to get the proper 
texts for every day).

While it might seem contradictory to get grace by staying away from the Blessed
Sacrament: participating in a rite that is riddled with scandal and heresy and is 
a danger to faith is not Catholic, nor can the Church obligate one to (see 
[What obedience do we owe the Pope?](/obedience)).

It is not the goal of the editorial team to prevent anyone from getting grace:
the opposite! However, Catholics have to be aware that not every "sacrifice" nowadays
is pleasing to God. 

Editorial note: I have found it difficult myself to adjust to this, as you, 
I wanted to "be a good Catholic, go to Mass". However, being around priests who are
silent or compromising resulted in me sliding into laxity. After all, I was going
throught the motions. Once I stopped doing that and started to seek out priests,
who were cancelled and supressed for their opinions - only then I started to actually
severely grow in my Faith. It is hard, even for me, to tell you this, as I obviously
get a lot of pushback, I'd love to have more friends at Mass, etc. I am human too.
But I cannot overlook the elephant in the room and feign a "Unity of the Church" 
with people who are heretical (nevermind that my local NO is mostly attended by liberal 
60+ year olds).
