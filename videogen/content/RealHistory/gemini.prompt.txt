Convert this article into a form that is readable by elevenlabs. 
The original that this article was made from is a subtitbled video (srt attached). 

Keep the original speaking style, but follow the articles line of argumentation. 

The original audio had lots of interruptions, side-tracked thoughts, etc. 

My final goal is to create an automatically-edited video with subtitles in various languages. 

So, the goals is to output a JSON file with timestamps from the original video and translated text, 
so that I can later use ffmpeg to automatically cut the video together and use AI to dub it.

Output should be a JSON list of sections:

```
[{'start': '00:00:05', 'end': '00:00:10', 'dub': 'This text will appear as a subtitle.'}]
```

Then I can use elevenlabs to generate the "dub" and use ffmpeg to cut and dub the video. 

This way I can shorten the video and reduce unnecessary elements.
