Transcript of a Talk by Fr. Hesse: The New Conciliar Religion - Part 2

# Fr. Hesse: The New Conciliar Religion - Part 2

## Modern Church Experience and the Importance of Reverence



And in the same encyclical, and with this, I conclude because I'm sick and tired of it. In this same encyclical, the Pope says, "With the incarnation of Christ, man has been revealed to himself." Wow. He's only quoting *Gaudium et Spes* number 22. Man has been revealed to himself. Until this Pope taught me to forget my old faith, I had always believed that the New Testament had revealed the Son and the Holy Spirit to us. I always thought that the message of the New Testament was revealing to some the incarnation and the Holy Spirit. And this Pope tells me man has been revealed to himself? I think he was in India for too long. That's why people went in the '60s to find themselves. Yay. Yeah.



So what we have here all together is not only a new church, it is a Gnostic sect. Look up in the dictionary the word G-N-O-S-T-I-C. Look it up in the dictionary, Gnostic. It comes from gnosis. (German), no, enlightenment. There is no good translation in English for the word gnosis. There's only one in, not even Italian. *Erkenntnis* in German. Sometimes in psychology, modern psychology, even in the English language, the word *Erkenntnis* is used for that reason, because there's no proper term in English. It's the fact that you realize something, but there's no word for the realization, but I don't think that's good English. So that's gnosis. Now, a Gnostic sect, I don't have to explain to you what a sect is. You know about the Jehovah Witnesses. I like them much more than the new church because the Jehovah Witnesses at least try to mission, to convert other people, which personally, subjectively speaking is a nice effort. Now, in the modern church, they will tell you to join another religion instead. So a Gnostic sect is a sect that believes that man is the superior being, and only the recognition of things in our brain is what counts, which means you have a purely subjective religion, which means you make your own religion, and which means you can do whatever you want, it'll be fine. That'd be nice. As Gilbert Keith Chesterton said, "If I was not a Catholic, I would have a harem." (laughing) So, you see how absurd, you see the absurdity of things. We are living in a Gnostic sect founded by Vatican II, which our dear beloved present Pope calls the Second Pentecost, and I cannot say amen to that. I disagree with him. He's a heretic. I reject his teachings. I do not reject his papacy. I reject what he does in his papacy, and I reject what he says, period.



## Questions and Answers



**Question:** What do you do, like, if, for people who can't reach an old Latin mass? I have a sister that lives in West Virginia, and, you know, she has small children. And I mean, you know...

**Answer:** Yeah. Well, I think that question's on yesterday's tape, so I can answer it briefly now. You must not go to the new mass because the new mass is against the will of the church, against the will of God. It's against divine law. It is an illegal rite, illicit. It's not only against divine law, it's against eternal law too. Eternal law is first and divine law as an interpretation of his own eternal law. And then, positive law, natural law, and then positive law. It's against positive law pronounced by Pius V. It's against the natural law, as the tradition of the church, and it's against divine law as the dogma of the Council of Trent, and it's against eternal law therefore. You cannot attend the Novus Ordo Mass unless you have to for social purposes, like you did. And in this case, you do not say amen because amen does not mean all right, it's okay. Amen means yes, yes, yes. You can't say yes to the new mass. The new mass does not represent the Catholic faith. But, yesterday's conference, I can give you more information on that later on. But now, as the camera is running...



**Question:** Father, what do you think our chances are to get back to good practice in mass?

**Answer:** Humanly speaking, zilch, zero, rien, nada, nix, nichts, gar nichts, nichevo, niente. In other words, none. (laughing) Thank you. (laughing) Humanly speaking. I'm not... God has to work a miracle on that, but I mean, I don't know if God will work a miracle. He might end the world. I don't know. I don't know. I ain't no prophet.



**Questioner:** But they're not... deep down know that, you know, they're-

**Answer:** I'm not judging people who do not know. You cannot commit a sin if you don't know. Sometimes ignorance is a sin, but not the thing you do because of ignorance.



**Comment:** I call it the nervous order.

**Answer:** You what? (laughing)



**Commenter:** I call it the nervous order.

**Answer:** Very good. Yeah. You should call it the nervous disorder. (laughing)



**Commenter:** I'll walk in without a chip on my shoulder and go back with a chip on my shoulder. It's a... Absolutely, yeah. I'm radically disoriented.

**Answer:** Well, it's a disorder, but we talked about it yesterday. Is everything I told you about Vatican II so crystal clear that there are no questions? I doubt that. Don't be afraid of asking a stupid question. Only the one who laughs about the stupid question is stupid.



**Question:** Tell us about the Masons that you think infiltrated in the Vatican, the Masons.

**Answer:** Well, I know that several cardinals were masons. I don't know about living cardinals. I have no information on that. I doubt there is no mason among the cardinals, but I don't know how many. I know several cardinals were masons. There's no sense in naming names here. Most of them you won't know anyway. And I know that the masons have tried already in the last century to infiltrate the church, and they succeeded because Pope Leo XIII's secretary of state was a mason. But this I have said in my first conference. You will have it on tape. And as far as the infiltration of the church is concerned, I can give you an information which I did not mention, I forgot. The day before yesterday, in the 1930s, Stalin started already to insert KGB agents into Western seminaries. And in 1974, NATO in its annual report, not the report you could buy at the newspaper stand, but the report that fortunately I got to see, estimated 3,000 KGB agents to be found among the Catholic hierarchy. That means priests and bishops. 3,000 KGB agents.



**Questioner:** That was NATO?

**Answer:** NATO in 1974. Don't kill me if it was '76, but I think it was '74.



**Questioner:** Are they in the Vatican?

**Answer:** Of course there are KGB agents in the Vatican. You think the KGB is stupid? The KGB is not the CIA, Christians In Action. That's a field term for them. And the infiltration, it must be deep down.



**Question:** ... by keeping your hands, that it is said by Martin Luther. And the total rejection of... total rejection of our Lord. Of the real presence. Of the real presence of our Lord in the Eucharist. And that's when he brought it all out of-

**Answer:** Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is, it is, and it is very typical of Martin Luther because it's not typical Cranmer. Now Cranmer permitted communion on the hand, but he did not allow the communicant to stand. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, the founder of the Anglican rite. He insisted on the communicant kneeling because he believed it was symbolic bread that could contain, like a can, you know? Contain Christ for those who believe in it. Luther insisted fully and totally on the meal. This is why the Novus Ordo Church doesn't have an altar. It has a buffet table. Yeah, Luther said so. The Herr Doktor Martin Luther said, "An altar is for sacrifice. A table is for a meal." And now we have the Catholic churches with tables, including St. Peter's Basilica now, not the papal altar. The papal altar can't be changed, can't be turned around. That's a different thing. I would have to give a special lecture on old altars of basilicas in Rome. There was never in the history an altar facing the people. The altar always went toward the East. Yes, right. So if the apse of a church had to be built in the West, then the altar had to be turned around. Okay. But in St. Peter's Basilica, in the apse of St. Peter's Basilica, at the chair of St. Peter's where I was ordained, right there, now they have taken away, they have covered up the old altar facing God and they have what I call encrusted spaghetti, the new altar. It looks like encrusted and colored spaghetti. And that's the new altar there.



**Comment:** In Florida, I went with my daughter to one of the masses attained for. And after participating in the church with her father-in-law. She sat there 10 feet from the altar.

**Answer:** Yeah. Only in bishops' churches in the old days, that's what it had to be for the simple reason that when a bishop celebrates the pontifical high mass, the blessed sacrament must not be on the altar. This is symbolic because the bishop fully represents Christ. I only partially represent Christ. I'm not a full priest. I'm a priest good enough for saying mass, I'm not a priest good enough for making priests. These hands are not fertile. I cannot have children. Priests, I mean. Otherwise I could, but I cannot have children, right? These hands cannot consecrate, so I'm not a full priest. And the bishop when he celebrates, especially the bishop of his diocese, on the altar has seven candle holders like the old menorah. There's not the six candles, but there's a seventh candle put up in front of the cross in the center because now he's the full priest, the high priest. The bishop of his own diocese. And the bishop of his own diocese, therefore, does not have the blessed sacrament on his altar, but in the chapel. A cathedral always has a chapel of the blessed sacrament. So nobody could complain about the fact that St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York does not have the blessed sacrament on the high altar. That's normal. That's right. Because it's an Episcopal Church, not Episcopalian. It's the church of the bishop. It's a cathedral. And, but a regular parish church has to have the blessed sacrament in the center of the church and not somewhere shoved away. But this is what the conciliar church thinks about the blessed sacrament, and again, it shows because it's part of liturgy. Well, anyway, the point is, the point is you cannot fulfill your Sunday obligation at the new mass, you must not attend the new mass, and you must not collaborate with them.



**Question:** Would you work for the local Episcopalian Church?

**Answer:** No, I think this was my daughter.



**Questioner:** No, I'm asking her. Would you work for the local Episco-

**Answer:** No, why not? They're much better than what you're working for. Huh? I prefer the Episcopalians 10 times over even if they got a bishop resident in Boston now, but who cares? So far, actually, none of the sacraments were cut out.



**Questioner:** I don't...

**Answer:** No, no, no, no. I didn't say that. Oh, be careful. Be very careful with what you say. If a modern priest, no matter what language he uses, no matter what ritual he uses, if a modern priest has the intention to baptize a child into the Catholic Church for the forgiving of the original sin, and if he says so, then the baptism is valid, as the baptism of a Muslim right out on the highway would be valid. If I have an accident on the highway and there's a guy with me in the car who is not baptized, and the only one passing by is an Arab with a towel head, and I want somebody, I can't move, I'm right there in the car, and this guy right next to me says, "Father, please baptize me. I think I'm gonna die." I would have to wait until somebody shows up and I would ask this Muslim to find me the bottle with water back there and baptize the guy next to me. The church has said everybody can baptize, unless he does not have the intention to do what the church does. Now, when an Arab in an old towel head, says, "You good men, I do what you want," then he wants to do what the church does. He doesn't know what the church does, but he wants to do what I want, and what I want is what the church does. No? So he wants to do what the church does. This is the old teaching of the church. That's not new. So, unless the forgiving of the original sin is excluded, it's valid. If a new priest says, "You're hereby received in our community and I congratulate you, and therefore, I receive you right here and I baptize you in the name of..." This is not a valid baptism, because baptism is not a reception into a community. Baptism, the essential baptism is to get rid of original sin.



**Comment:** All they have on stage is baptism.

**Answer:** Excuse d- All about deacon baptism. Perfect agreement. The church is in perfect agreement. A deacon can baptize. A deacon always could baptize. And a deacon always could solemnly baptize.



**Questioner:** And they know what are though, so when they- So they're not. You guys know our culture too well.

**Answer:** Oh, we did that? That's why we know it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's not a deacon. He's not a deacon in the priesthood, he's a deacon that's been made a deacon. A man of the community.



**Questioner:** And they know what are they?

**Answer:** Yeah, but wait a second. Again, it has nothing to do with the culture here. Again, the question is, is he a validly ordained deacon? I don't know. I have no idea. I'm not sure. But again, again, listen. I told you before, we are talking about two different things here. Even if he isn't. Even if he isn't. He could... Of course. He's still- We must not confuse- We can talk about all these things. We must not confuse licitness and validity.



**Questioner:** We can back up. Who's talking here? I or you?

**Answer:** That's okay. Okay, now. We're not talking about licitness. We're talking about validity. I just told you anybody, anybody, a woman too, even a woman can baptize.



**Questioner:** Oh, yeah?

**Answer:** Yeah, well, there you go. So, he's only pointing out-



**Questioner:** Wait, you're missing it. What I'm saying is this, that you listen to... The baptismal manuals are stuff that studies them, and they have no intention of doing what the church does, hopefully.

**Answer:** Exactly. That's what I said. If you use one of those books, and one of those books tells you you're receiving somebody into a club, there is no baptism. Huh? But if that deacon, let's say, is a better man than his ritual, and using the liberty of liturgy in our days, uses... has the manual right there, but he says, "We receive this beautiful child here into the church because... and we baptize this beautiful child because it has to get rid of original sin," then baptism is valid. Baptism, not Mass. Baptism.



**Comment:** My daughter told me last week at Justin's church in Florida, they baptized and made their first, and they come from Asia all at one time.

**Answer:** They gotta do it anyway. She- That's illicit, but not necessarily invalid. Depends what they say. Baptism is always valid when the extermination of original sin is not excluded, is implicit.



**Question:** Does it matter if they define original sin in a different way since then?

**Answer:** Yes, it matters if it's-



**Questioner:** Since the environment.

**Answer:** Yes. Yes. Yes. That's the trouble with it. Yeah. If original sin is not seen as a spiritual-



**Commenter:** Teaching's the religion teachers, so I don't know what they do in the seminary. They teach the religion teachers that original sin is not as we previously perceived, but as something that you're born into, something like the environment.

**Answer:** Well, the exact words are, "It's condition of the world." Yeah. You can't get rid of the conditions of the world by one child being baptized. That's why we have to protect the spotted owls. Yeah. Oh, it's too bad though. Yeah, collect the whole collection.



**Question:** Going back to the Mass, give me your opinion. Give us your opinion on Mother Angelica's Mass.

**Answer:** Who? Mother Angelica. She's- I don't follow these things. I'm not interested in what happens out there.



**Questioner:** You gotta look at the front, see. It's the Novus Ordo. It's terrible.

**Answer:** Yeah, I'm not interested in what they do.



**Questioner:** But generally, it's all she does is say a few little Latin phrases to make it look good to people.

**Answer:** That's all? Oh, it's a woman? Mother Angelica?



**Questioner:** Not Angelica. She was the one that started hearing some noises.

**Answer:** And she says Mass?



**Questioner:** No. Not her full nationality. No. Oh. It's Novus Ordo?

**Answer:** Yeah. Hey, wait a second. This is- It's not Novus Ordo. It's Novus Ordo. Quiet. Shut up. (laughs) What's the Mother Angelica Messes? Novus Ordo? It's Novus Ordo. Well, what I said about Novus Ordo? Well, that, it doesn't matter. Okay, might be valid. It might not be. I would have to hear it and judge it, and, but I'm not the Holy Office either.



**Questioner:** Well- Well, that's fine 'cause it's the Catholic Church.

**Answer:** Yeah. Yeah. Well, the new Mass, if the new Mass is said strictly to the book, strictly to the book in Latin, strictly to the book.



**Questioner:** Today, her Masses aren't that way.

**Answer:** Yeah. Well, if it is strictly to the book, said in Latin, by... Wait a second. If it is strictly to the book, if the man who celebrates the Mass has been ordained strictly to the book, leaving nothing out, changing nothing, then I consider it valid.



**Questioner:** No, he does not. No, he- See, the thing is-

**Answer:** You'd have to be a theologian.



**Questioner:** The thing is what you miss...

**Answer:** No, no, I'm not, I'm not contesting the validity here. But if... it's not an issue. The validity is not an issue in that case, because generally speaking, the validity of the new Mass is of no concern to us. Why? The Orthodox... the Russian Orthodox Mass is valid. You still can't go there. The Russian Orthodox Mass is an insult to God because it's celebrated by a priest who rejects the papal infallibility and the primacy of the pope. But the Russian Orthodox Mass is valid. The Greek Orthodox Mass, they're heretics and schismatics, but the Greek Orthodox Mass is always valid. I'm not interested, basically, if the new Mass is valid or not. The reason why I tell you, "Do not go to communion in the new church," is because you do not know and you are bound by the church to follow the safer course. That means go to St. Pius X. You're not allowed to go to the new Mass. But if Mother Angelica's Mass is valid or not, I don't care. Whatever they do there is against the will of God, it's against the will of the Council of Trent, it's against the will of St. Pius V, it's against divine law, it's against eternal law. What are you concerned with? Why do you break your head over something that is illicit anyway?



**Questioner:** Well, the extraordinary phrase that they hear, they hear Latin used and they add to that-

**Answer:** Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, but it isn't, you see? No. No. Say it once and for all, it is not. It is not.



**Questioner:** That's right. But that's your opinion.

**Answer:** No, that's not my opinion. This is the opinion of the Council of Trent. Right. The Council of Trent in the seventh session, Canon 13 says, "Whoever says that any of the pastors," that includes the pope, any of the pastors, "Whoever says that any of the pastors may add unto liturgy, subtract from liturgy, or write up a new liturgy-"



**Questioner:** But I don't see it subtracted or added or inverted in that Mass.

**Answer:** In the new Mass?



**Questioner:** In the old one over here, Father, because this way-

**Answer:** Did you follow it with the old missal? Did you follow it with the old missal in your hand?



**Questioner:** I have many times. Oh. With your traditional missal in your hand?

**Answer:** Yes.



**Questioner:** With the traditional missal?

**Answer:** I did not do it today. Does the priest say *(Latin)*? Yes. Oh, is it the old Mass there? No. So what I understood is that if you use Father's criteria, which is another way to say the true Mass is the real problem. If he says the true Mass, fine. If he doesn't, then it's not. Yeah. From what I hear, she just adds a little Latin to fool the people.



**Questioner:** It's not for the consecration, she does add to it.

**Answer:** But it's not just the consecration.



**Questioner:** No, it's not just the consecration. The whole, the whole thing.

**Answer:** Yes. Yeah, it must be the whole thing.



**Questioner:** There are some of them that are real, right from the beginning to the end.

**Answer:** No, no, no. No, I would have heard of that. Next question.



**Questioner:** Every time that I went to see it.

**Answer:** Yeah. Well, you got the criteria and check with the old missal and that will give you the answer. Father Kessler can only give you the theology. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I don't know what's going on in Mother Angelica's Mass, so I can only answer in principle, okay?



**Questioner:** Yes. Every time that I have seen Mother Angelica's Mass, the Latin is at the beginning. Consecration comes in English, three priests are on the altar trying to do consecration. Consecration is in English, and the words used are for all. The new translation.

**Answer:** That's the new Mass. Yeah, that's the new Mass. Definitely the new Mass. That's definitely the new Mass, and therefore I'm not interested if it's valid or not because it's illicit in any case.



**Questioner:** I'll have to pay more attention.

**Answer:** Yeah. It's against the divine law in any case. Yeah.



**Commenter:** That's what's good about those buttons. You can turn it off.

**Answer:** The what?



**Commenter:** That's what's good about the buttons, you can turn them off.

**Answer:** Oh, I would never switch it on. I mean, I watch good movies. (laughing) Yeah, I would never, I would never watch a Mass on TV. I just, I prefer a good movie. Give me *Red October* any time.



**Questioner:** But they're such beautiful priests. That's the only thing. They're so-

**Answer:** They're so beautiful priests?



**Questioner:** Very nice.

**Answer:** I prefer beautiful girls. Uh, go ahead. It reminds me of this old Dutch priest who used to-



**Questioner:** We're not talking about... We're not speaking of the outer appearance of the priest.

**Answer:** Oh.



**Questioner:** I'm speaking of their inner, their manner.

**Answer:** Oh, maybe they're, maybe, maybe they're almost saints but what they do is against divine law. Yeah. See, I'm a rotten bum but what I do at Mass is not against divine law.



**Question:** Father, what order are you?

**Answer:** Excuse me?



**Questioner:** What order are you?

**Answer:** Diocesan.



**Questioner:** Diocesan?

**Answer:** Yep. I'm Diocesan.



**Commenter:** Next thing she'll want to know is your bishop. (laughs)

**Questioner:** You are a bishop?

**Answer:** No, no, her is bishop so you can report him. (laughing) Report me, you'll have fun.



**Question:** I wanted to ask you, in Europe they have all the Novus Ordo also all over Europe, is the case?

**Answer:** They have the Novus Ordo all over the world, and the Novus Ordo has been introduced into the Eastern countries, which is one of the beautiful results of the so-called opening in '89. In Brno in Czechoslovakia I could see how far they've gone with the Novus Ordo, because in a beautiful church, I think it's St. Thomas Church in Brno, they had an evening Mass, maybe it was an evening service, in Czech, with a new Mass in Czech, with an altar, a so-called altar facing the people, which means with the usual gourmet dining table, and buffet table. And gorgeous Czech blondes at medium age, 21, in tight-fitting dress were singing for the Mass.



**Questioner:** Where is this? Where is this?

**Answer:** St. Thomas in Brno, if you want to go there. (laughing) So they have been fully Novus Ordo-zied. Yeah, fully Nova Zoroastrian. Yeah. And the cardinal, the cardinal archbishop of Prague is a modernist to the core. Yeah.



**Commenter:** But it took 30 years for this to take off.

**Answer:** Almost 60- Yeah, it took 2,000 years to build the church to the point where it was, and it took 30 years for them almost to tear it down. But rest assured, we will survive, thanks to the Society of St. Pius X. Amen. Yeah.



**Question:** And Fatima. Don't you think that Fatima also predicts that the Third Secret is what's going on today?

**Answer:** Well, I cannot give you a definite answer on that. I haven't read it. But this is the only, the only logical answer. It's the only logical answer, but sometimes logics are not the answer. I have to be diplomatic on that. I don't know.



**Questioner:** Do you believe in them?

**Answer:** Hmm?



**Questioner:** Do you believe in them? (laughs)

**Answer:** I sure believed in something that was approved by a miracle that has been seen by 70,000 people, and by some other people in 15 miles distance from the place where the miracle took place. This is the only reason why I believe in Fatima, because principally, I'm against visions, against apparitions, and against miracles. I do not believe them until they're proven. As I give you one example, this is interesting to know for you. Saint Catherine Laboure, she was the one with the miraculous medal. Saint Catherine Laboure had apparitions from Our Lady. I believe they're true for one reason. There is one incident in the evening, in the late afternoon, Saint Catherine Laboure had another apparition from Our Lady. Our Lady was sitting in a chair. Saint Catherine Laboure knelt with her hands in the lap of Our Lady, imagine, and they had a nice conversation. And then the bells rang for vespers. Now, you know nuns are supposed to attend vespers, okay? The bells rang for vespers, and Saint Catherine Laboure got up and said to Our Lady, "I'm sorry, I have to go." And went to vespers and let Our Lady sit there.



**Questioner:** Oh. Oh, so you don't believe in the temple was it, huh?

**Answer:** The next day, Our Lady came back and said to Saint Catherine Laboure, "If you had not gone to vespers as you were commanded to last night, I would not have been allowed to come back." Oh. That should teach you something.



**Questioner:** That's authentic.

**Answer:** No, that's definitely authentic. Authentic. That is authentic. Because that's the whole point, you see? Most of the apparitions go against the Church teaching. That crazy lunatic down there in Northern Italy called Don Gobbi, with the Marian Movement, who supposedly has Our Lady appearing to him for many years already.



**Questioner:** What's the name? Don Gobbi. Who is it? Who is that?

**Answer:** Oh, if you don't know him- Oh, oh, oh. Gobbi. Don Gobbi. Oh, what a bummer. Yeah. Stefano Gobbi. Yeah. And Don Stefano Gobbi is as authentic as a Diet Coke. And-



**Questioner:** That's true.

**Answer:** He is, he is-



**Questioner:** Diet Coke. He said to get a Diet Coke.

**Answer:** A Diet Coke is not Coke, come on. He is as authentic as a Diet Coke, because he claims to have apparitions from Our Lady, and visions, and whisperings from her, but he endorses the new mass and the ecumenical movement. And now he's saying it's- And in Medjugorje, something similar happened. So Medjugorje is a business fraud anyway. No, Medjugorje was started by a couple of youngsters who wanted to make a joke, and two greedy Franciscans found out how you can make money that way. Franciscans always know how to make money, believe me. And Medjugorje is not authentic, because first of all, Our Lady says the rosary there. That means Our Lady says the Hail Mary. Our Lady cannot say the Hail Mary.



**Questioner:** Really?

**Answer:** No, of course not. Imagine. How can you say that? How can Our Lady say, pray for us sinners? That would be blasphemy. She's no sinner. No, she never was. Right. Huh? And so Medjugorje is fraud. Look, in Bayside, Our Lady, quotes end quote, said that the unknown flying objects, the flying saucers, are vehicles for the demons. According to my theology, a demon doesn't need a vehicle. (laughs) No. And he has no driver's license. He has no driver's license, he has no pilot license.



**Question:** Father, why, I mean, why can't you get more priests to be like you and...

**Answer:** No, why can't we- Don't say that. It's against the rule of humility of Saint Benedict. Do not praise me in public. You can say it to me in private. I'll say, "Thanks, madam." (laughs)



**Question:** Well, what can we do to help propagate, to walk away from the-

**Answer:** Make everybody in the United States subscribe to *The Angelus*. This is what you can do.



**Questioner:** But I want-

**Answer:** Hey, you wanted to know what you can do? Make everybody in the United States subscribe to *The Angelus*. This is what you can do.



**Questioner:** Get some forms we can- Society of St. Pius X Chapel. We can get some forms we can mail them to.

**Answer:** Yep. Yep. Subscribe to *The Angelus*. That's all I can tell you. And never forget, never forget one thing, because I know how people, how demanding people are, especially nowadays. Everybody wants to have his own priest, a priest to his liking. Don't. You have no right to. You have no right to.



**Question:** How do we get our young children, our teenagers and our 30-somethings-

**Answer:** Let them read the, what is it called?



**Questioner:** They don't need. They look at TV.

**Answer:** Yeah. Right. Show them these tapes. If they have, if the only perception left to these poor children is visual, let them have my tapes. They have the ****** tapes. Yeah. And as far as the Society of St. Pius X is concerned, I will never get tired of reminding people of the fact sometimes it could happen to you, that you have a personal experience of lesser enjoyability, that's politically correct talk, with one of the priests of the Society of St. Pius X. Do not be disillusioned. Do not stay away. In the old days... In the last century, not every parish priest was a joy. And yet, you went to his Sunday mass, right?



**Questioner:** Right. Well, I remember- So don't make that mistake. I went to his Sunday mass.

**Answer:** I ha- It has happened. It happened to several. I couldn't say many because the very great, the very vast majority of the priests of the Society of Saint Pius X are good and holy men. But of course, they're not all perfect. Some of them will not be your style, let's say. Some of them you might not like as much as you unfortunately like me. (laughs) But some of them might not be what you expect. But let this be of no concern to you. You're not going there to see a priest. You're going there to have mass. If you like the priest, then enjoy him. If you don't like him, pray for him. But go to the mass.



**Questioner:** Because he's valid. Because only at the Chapel of Saint Pi-

**Answer:** Because it's licit. Not because it's valid, but because it's licit.



**Questioner:** If he is licit, something will turn up in that library.

**Answer:** Of course it's valid. Otherwise, it wouldn't be licit. But validity is not sufficient. A mass has to be valid and licit. That means it has to be in the law of God. It has to be a pleasing act to God. It has to be what God wants. And listen to his sermons. Listen to his sermons. Listen to his sermons because only at the Chapel of Saint Pius X you can be sure that the sermon was correct. It might be an utterly boring sermon. I don't know. It might be a thrilling sermon. But only at the Chapel of Saint Pius X you will be sure the sermon is correct. At, with the Fraternity of Saint Peter, you get a lot of you know what sometimes. And with the other groups. With the Society of Saint Pius X, you can rest assured that the sermons are correct, and in order. They might sometimes be not of very great interest to you, but they will always be correct. You cannot be misled by them. That's the point. Now, how are their priests formed that led me to say that? Their priests are formed in a way that bishops in the 1930s would be happy to have had. Seminaries in the 1930s were not nearly at the intellectual and spiritual level of the Seminary of Winona under the leadership of Bishop Williamson.



**Questioner:** Excuse me, Rich- uh, Williamson. Richard Williamson?

**Answer:** Yeah. Richard Williamson. Huh?



**Questioner:** Where's he make you?

**Answer:** Winona, Minnesota. Oh. That's the seminary for the Society of Saint Pius X in America. In North America, I should say. South America, you have the one, La Reja, in Argentine. And they have seminaries that are very strict, like military academies, and on a level that most bishops dreamed of 70 years ago. Huh? The only reason why I never joined the Society of Saint Pius, one of the few reasons why I never joined the Society of Saint Pius X is because I do not get wine on weekdays, and I do not accept that. (laughs) Period. But there is nothing wrong with them as far as important things are concerned. Believe me.



**Questioner:** But you don't watch television sometimes. You know?

**Answer:** No, I would give that up readily.



**Questioner:** Really?

**Answer:** No. Because I know you're not allowed to watch television. Wine is 10,000 times more important than movies. (laughs) Okay. Any other question left?



**Commenter:** With the purifier.

**Answer:** The what?



**Commenter:** Wine is a purifier.

**Answer:** Among many other things. But Gilbert Keith Chesterton, as usual, was right when he said, "There's only one legitimate motive to drink wine, and this is because you like it." (laughs)



**Questioner:** You said it.

**Answer:** No, I just said because you like it.



**Question:** What do you think of this pope, running from-

**Answer:** Uh, didn't I express my opinion very clearly? Yeah. Yeah, that was very clear.



**Questioner:** I mean, where, where did he go? Who do you think is gonna succeed him? What do you think will happen?

**Answer:** Madam, I ain't no prophet. (laughs) Read the... They have a bunch of candidates. I know that the chance of a Catholic pope succeeding is minimal.



**Questioner:** Who's your buddy going to be? (laughs)

**Answer:** Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. That's right.



**Questioner:** Are you rooting for a holy pope?

**Answer:** Uh, humanly speaking, no. But I ain't no prophet. No. But Elliot is a prophet. Achou ain't no prophet. (laughs)



**Questioner:** Who are the good ones that possibly could be?

**Answer:** Forget it.



**Questioner:** Forget it? They're not that good?

**Answer:** Don't forget I can't look into the hearts of men. There might be a hidden good man, turn out to be, turn out differently than expected. Huh? He may boomerang on them. Yes. And that's our only chance.



**Questioner:** But then (inaudible)

**Answer:** Yeah. That's right. He might be. So maybe that-
