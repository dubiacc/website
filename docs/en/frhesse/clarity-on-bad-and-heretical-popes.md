Transcript of the talk by Fr. Hesse: Clarity on Bad and Heretical Popes

# Fr. Hesse - Clarity on Bad and Heretical Popes

## The Sacred Name of God and Obedience

As we are all, first of all, under obedience to God, and only then under obedience to man. There's a very interesting poem that my good friend, Gilbert Keith Chesterton, wrote about the name of God. In the Old Testament, and even at the time of the New Testament, it was normal, everyday thinking, and good thinking, too, that the name not only means to distinguish one guy from another, but that the name stands for his real being. So in the Old Testament, pronouncing the name of God was put under capital punishment. That's slightly exaggerated, but it's good thinking. It is put under capital punishment in the New Testament in the sense that the second commandment says if you name God in vain, in serious circumstances, you're in mortal sin against the second commandment.

This is why sometimes I will find myself in the condition of having to tell people in the confessional to use certain dirty words, but please don't insult the name of our Lord. You never say "Jesus Christ" unless you want to pray. You never name the most holy name of Jesus Christ unless you want to pray. If you discover yourself naming Jesus Christ just because you're frustrated, angry, or hurt, then you realize, I hope, that you just committed a sin against the second commandment. The name of God is sacred as God is sacred.

And Chesterton describes that very aptly in my favorite poem:

> The vision of a haloed host that weep around an empty throne.
> Aureoles dark and angels dead.
> Man with his own life stands alone.
> 'I am,' he says his bankrupt creed.
> 'I am.' And is again a clod.
> The sparrow starts, the grasses stir.
> For he has said the name of God.

Those of you who understand poetry will immediately know what it means. It means the real name of God is "I am." The name of God... So they tried to stone him, and he had to escape, because he had just named the name of God for himself. What you know and believe, and I know and believe, is that he is the son of God, the son of the living God, as Peter called him, and therefore he can say, "I am." You cannot. I cannot say, "I am." I will have to say, "I'm a man." "I'm 45." "I'm a priest." "I'm this and this and this and that." I cannot say, "I am," period.

God is infinitely simple. He is only being itself. He is the one who is subsistent. We will come back to that. He is the one who is subsistent to everything that is. If it was possible that he would cease to exist, we all would perish in the same instant. Everything else would. There is nothing ever without receiving his being from God. If God was to talk about himself, without adding a lot of things in order to make himself understood to our primitive and complicated minds, all that God Father, Son, and Holy Spirit could say about themself was, "I am." God Father cannot say anything but, "I am." God Son cannot say anything but, "I am." God Holy Spirit cannot say anything but, "I am." If there was anything to be added to it, it's only for our benefit in order to understand qualities that are all the same for him. It needs the complicated, extremely fallible, and mostly stupid human mind to distinguish between justice and mercy. Some people believe justice and mercy are opposite to each other. They cannot be, because in God, they are the same. There is no such thing as God merciful and God just. It's the same for him. He is. And if you ask him in heaven, "What are you?" He will only tell you, "I am."

There is nothing that can be without God. Christ said that to the apostles. He said, "Without me, you are nothing." He said on another occasion, "Everything that you are, you owe to God." Saint Paul said, "Everything that I am..." And Saint Paul was not stupid. He knew that there was a lot of things that he was, like intelligent, wise, educated, brilliant. He knew it. But he said, "It's nothing, because I received it all from God. I cannot be anything without God."

It is, therefore... And this is the reason why I started my second part of the presentation talking about God himself...It is, therefore, absurd to talk about obedience in any other context but obedience to God first.

## True Obedience: The Ten Commandments and Church Magisterium

If I know the will of God, not through a private inspiration, drop that, forget it. If you feel you have a vision, talk back at the vision badly. If it's an authentic vision, it will make sure to answer the right thing. Forget visions, miracles, inspirations. They are nothing, nothing. Obey the Ten Commandments and obey the magisterium of the church. That is obedience. You do what the church says and what the church always taught, and you follow the Ten Commandments, no matter who appears to you, no matter what you hear in the vision, no matter what you feel in the inspiration.

Saint Catherine Laboure, she was the one who was given the privilege to reveal the magnificence and the benefits of the miraculous medal of Our Lady to us. She also had the absolutely unbelievable privilege of having conversation with Our Lady, resting in her lap. She touched Our Lady. She was just having good conversation with Our Lady when, in her monastery, she said to Our Lady, because she was a saint, not a stupid human being, she said to Our Lady, "I'm sorry, I have to go to Vespers." She left Our Lady sitting there, and she went for Vespers. The next day, Our Lady told her, "If yesterday you had not obeyed the bells for Vespers, I would not have come back again." That is to tell you something about obedience. But Saint Catherine Laboure, whose body is one of the few still absolutely immaculately preserved, Saint Catherine Laboure obeyed something that was in perfect harmony with the church tradition, with the tradition of her own monastery. It is exactly according to church tradition that when the bell rings for Vespers, you go there. You don't say, "I'm sorry, I'm just on the phone. I can't come right now." No. If you're talking to the Pope himself, you say, "Sorry, Holy Father. The bell for Vespers just rang. I call you back tomorrow." Click. You hang up, and you go for Vespers. That is church tradition. You follow church tradition in obedience, then you obey in the sense that our Lord was talking about obedience.

Today, they have a different concept of obedience. They are the people who tell you that no matter what you think, no matter what they said in the old days, no matter how you believed it to be, if the Pope tells you to do it, then you do it. As the old saying, "The Pope dyes his hair green, you better do it too." With the present pope, I wouldn't be surprised, but that's not Christian or Catholic obedience. Back in Germany or Austria, they used to say, "The way the Pope clears his throat, you are supposed to spit." That is a type of obedience that you will find in a military dictatorship. It's a type of obedience that you will find in other types of dictatorship. It's a type of obedience that even in the good old days, before Hillary turned it into a liberal outfit, would have been unthinkable in the Armed Forces of the United States. Unthinkable, even in basic training. It would have been unthinkable if the sergeant would get away with telling you, "Burn down the barracks." Unthinkable. However, there is a multitude of people out there running around who, without even blushing, would tell you to do that if the Pope asked it.

## The Pope's Role and Its Limits

And this is the second step for today's reasoning. The Pope is not, as such, the head of the church. That's a terrible mistake to say that. Who is the head of the church? Well, Christ only, only Christ himself. Those of you who are married, if they had Catholic preparation for marriage, know that marriage is something analogical to the relationship of Christ to his church. Man is supposed to represent Christ, and the wife is supposed to represent the church, and the relationship should be the one of church and Christ. And this is what Saint Paul says in one of his epistles. I think it's the Ephesians, letter to the Ephesians, where he says, "Just like Christ is the head of the church, man, the husband should be the head of the wife and the family, and just like the church loves Christ and follows Christ, the wife should love and follow her husband." We know in the White House it's the other way around, but the White House does not represent the church. On the contrary, the White House represents the enemy of the church.

Obedience itself can only be defined by the Ten Commandments and church tradition, not by some messed up, perverted philosopher of our century. And just like I mentioned the example yesterday, just like in the armed forces, the colonel cannot tell me to shoot my wife, because even if I was happy about that command and did shoot her, I would not get away with it. He does not have the right to tell me, "Shoot your wife," as long as my wife is not attacking the bases I'm stationed in. And commands are, as such, subject to higher rules. If the Pope, in a state of absent-mindedness, or being drunk, or whatever, would tell you, you having the privilege of dining with him, and he would tell you to jump out of the window, third floor of the Apostolic Palace, you would have to say, "Excuse me, Holy Father, I don't know why you're getting off the rocker, but I'm sure not gonna do that." And you do not commit a sin. On the contrary, you would if you followed him.

The Pope, just like any other human being, is bound to the Ten Commandments. The Pope is bound to the canon law that he published and signed. If he wants to, if he doesn't like something in the canon law that he published, then he has to change the canon law around as much as this is possible. But he cannot say, "Yes, well, we assure. Yeah, right. I signed the canon law of 1983, but I'm the Pope and I don't have to follow it." Wrong, wrong, wrong. The Pope has to follow the Ten Commandments, the will of Christ, the tradition of the Church, and his own canon law.

Pope Pius XI, who was a pretty good pope, I say, and who certainly knew his business, Pope Pius XI, when he celebrated mass, did not just choose what mass he was going to say today. You know, there's quite some differences. You will have one saint celebrated in one diocese and nowhere else, and then you will have another saint celebrated all over the world. But then in your diocese, he's not celebrated because that's the Feast of the Dedication of the cathedral of your diocese and whatever. So there are differences. Now, Pius XI as pope had to choose what calendar he will use. He was sitting up there in the Apostolic Palace, which basically speaks as the jurisdiction of Vatican City. Sometimes he was celebrating in Saint Peter's Basilica, which is the jurisdiction of Saint Peter's Basilica. Sometimes he was celebrating in some churches in Rome, which is the jurisdiction of Rome. And later on when popes started to travel, they had to face the situation of celebrating somewhere else, which was the jurisdiction of so-and-so. Pope Pius XI, who was not foolish enough to fall for all these traps that they do today, celebrated mass every day, strictly, if you liked it or not, strictly according to the calendar of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome. Because as pope, he is the titular priest of that basilica. He is, so to speak, the archpriest of the Basilica of Saint John of the Lateran. That is his church. Like a parish priest has his church, and Father Bolduc has his church. He's the boss in this church, and nobody else is. In the same way, Pope Pius XI, as a priest celebrating mass, he was the boss in Saint John Lateran, so he used the calendar of Saint John of the Lateran. That was a pope who understood the concept of obedience. The present pope grew up in a concept of dictatorship in Poland, and obviously hasn't learned anything from it, because he expects us to do things that we must not do.

## Limits to Obedience Towards the Pope and the Status Ecclesiae

And here we are at the topic of today: what is the limit to obedience towards the Pope? Towards the end of my, today's, presentation, I'm going to answer a few very intelligent and excellent questions that somebody, I don't know who, asked on this little sheet of paper together with an article published by a criminal in Rome, whom I'm going to talk about later.

One of the questions is, "Aren't we bound in total obedience to the Pope?" The answer is definitely not.
What are the limits to the Pope's freedom of decision?
Well, the Pope:
1.  Cannot go second.
2.  He cannot contradict the Church Fathers.
3.  Third, he cannot contradict the first four councils or any council as far, the first four councils as such, and he cannot contradict any further council as long as it is not dogmatically defined. Dogmatically defined things he cannot contradict. Things that the council decided forever, such as moral decisions, he cannot contradict. If we're talking about disciplinary regulations, which always were issued at councils and which nobody bothers to put in a collection of church teaching, yes, of course he can. But not dogmatic and moral decisions of a council.
4.  Number four, he cannot contradict what is called *Status Ecclesiae*, the state the church finds itself in. The state doesn't mean the present situation, like the state you find yourself in right now. The state is something unchangeable.

See, I am in the *status religionis*, in the *status sacerdotalis*. The state of my life is being a priest, and no matter if I go to heaven, purgatory or hell, I will still be a priest. I am *sacerdos in aeternum*, a priest in eternity. God Himself cannot take away my priesthood because He has decided to give it to me, and He cannot contradict Himself. My good friend, the Italian composer, Antonio Vivaldi, most of you only know his Four Seasons, which is sad. He wrote 450 beautiful concerts and 30 operas. Antonio Vivaldi's dead. Ever since the 28th of July 1741, Antonio Vivaldi still is a priest. Claudio Monteverdi, his predecessor in music, still is a priest today. Once a priest, always a priest. Like they say, "Once in the army, always in the army." But that means as long as you live, okay? A priest is an eternity, always, always in the army of God. So I'm in the *status sacerdotalis*. That doesn't change. It can't change. Sister, right here, or a bishop are in the *status perfectionis*, in the state of perfection. If anybody offered me to consecrate me a bishop, I would have to think twice about it, because I would have to give up all my hobbies. I would have to give up my beautiful wines. Not this one here, but I mean, the vintage wines, the bottled wines, the expensive ones. I would have to give up everything, because I would join the *status perfectionis*, the state of perfection, which is aptly described by Saint Theresa of Avila, saying that, "In the *status perfectionis*, there is nothing but your belonging to God." You become the total, absolute and total property of God. You replace your own soul and your own self with Christ. That's the *status perfectionis*. That state of life, as you call it in English, is basically unchangeable once you're in it. For the bishop, it is perfectly unchangeable. For sister, it is relatively unchangeable.

The state of the Church is something the Church will find herself in unchangeably forever. To show you what I mean, there are three steps, major steps in the sacrament of priesthood, diaconate, priesthood, and episcopal consecration. But there are the so-called minor orders. The highest of the minor orders is the subdiaconate. When Paul VI transgressed his faculties by making the subdiaconate optional... Another interesting thing, by the way, you remember when yesterday I said that the new Mass was never really published and that Vatican II was never really became obligatory, the same thing here again. The Holy Spirit is not dead. The Holy Spirit works in the Church. When Paul VI said, "We don't need the subdiaconate," he still left it up to the individual bishop to confer it or not. That's interesting. However, he went far beyond of what he's allowed to do when he said we don't need the subdiaconate anymore. The subdiaconate is going back to the earliest apostolic times of the Church. Therefore, it is part of the *status ecclesiae*, the state the Church finds herself in.

Now, yesterday, I hope I have made it sufficiently and abundantly clear to you that Holy Mass, the way we know it here in this chapel, is part of the Church tradition, and that it is perfectly illegal and impossible to change that. So Holy Mass, the way you and I know it, is part of the state of the Church, *status ecclesiae*. If the pope tries to change that, you'll say, "Sorry, Holy Father, but can't follow that. Too bad." If the pope tries to change anything that is part of the *status ecclesiae*, and you follow him, and you should know better, then you're in the state of mortal sin, unless you don't know better. But to follow the pope into error means not obedience, but sin. Remember what Saint Paul said, "If an angel out of heaven was to bring you another gospel, don't accept it, even if an angel himself."

And for those of you who understand poetry and understand the depth of poetry, what Chesterton really means when he says, "And if an angel out of heaven brings you other things to drink, thank him for his kind attention. Go and pour them down the sink." This is what he really meant. Chesterton himself drank beer, and quite barrels of it. So what he says in this poem that I quoted yesterday means, don't allow anything to creep into the gospel in its purity as it was preserved by the Church. See, this, in a way, is the gospel, because Father and I up there on the altar, we're not allowed to do that, but Father and I up there on the altar can turn this innocent-looking cup of wine into the blood of Christ if we used it for Mass. We'd be committing a sin, because we're not allowed to use a glass chalice, and we're not allowed to use this type of wine. We have to use Mass wine. Doesn't matter if it's white or red, by the way, but it's practical reason not to use red wine. But we're allowed to use it. The point is, we can do it. So this is representing the purity of the Gospel. And that's what Chesterton meant. Anybody who dares to interfere with the purity of church teaching, to interfere with the purity of church tradition... kind of cookie, you know, and use a consecrated host, our Lord Jesus Christ, in order to prepare dessert for your guests. That's an unbelievable and outrageous sacrilege.

Now, I hope none of you believes even for an instant that the Pope is incapable of doing that. Of course he's capable of doing that. He's a human being, and he could sin like you and me. He can do things wrong. Pope Alexander VI while he was pope had children. Is that the right thing to do? I don't think so. I mean, sure it isn't. The guy was enjoying himself, and he's not supposed to. So he had children. He said, "So what?" And popes did other things, too. There are stories about popes murdering other people. Well, I don't see why a pope couldn't do it. He should not do it. He must not do it. But I don't see why he would not be able to do it. So the pope himself could work, could do a sacrilege that puts himself in the state of excommunication reserved for the Holy See. How is that possible? Can he give absolution to himself like that? No. When a pope... You see, a pope has a confessor. Okay? Just like you and me. A pope has a confessor. So if a pope commits a sin that is under excommunication, strictly reserved to the Holy See, he has to seek his confessor and say, "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I've done this and this." The confessor will go, "What? I can't give you absolution for that." And he says... Pope will say... 'Cause the pope knows what he's talking about, I hope. He will say, "I know you can't give me absolution on that, but you just go the regular way." So the pope, without mentioning who was his penitent, will approach the office in the Vatican which is called the Apostolic... The *Penitentiaria Apostolica*, the Apostolic Penitentiary. And there he will anonymously denounce that sin and say, "Listen. Yesterday a guy confessed to me who said he did this and this and this." And then they will examine the case. The confessor might have to ask questions about this again. And then without naming who it is, he will talk to the cardinal in the *Penitentiaria Apostolica*. And then the cardinal will most probably, if it's the first time, say, "Okay. You can give absolution to this guy." So in that case, this cardinal decides in the name of the pope, and that's how a pope could get absolution for a sin that is punished with reserved absolution.

So the concept of a pope being outside the Church is old. Many popes talked about it. Pope Innocent III said that. Pope Innocent III said to all of his successors and all bishops, he said, "Don't ever make the mistake of thinking that because you have the graces, the power, and the dignity of the office, it doesn't matter if you commit a sin like this." And he reminded his successors saying, "Who cannot be judged by men will be judged all the more by God." With God, there is only justice, in no contradiction to mercy. And the most culpable person on Earth is always the pope no matter what happens, because he's the highest up. He's the highest person on Earth. He's not the head of the Church. He's only the highest person in the Church. He is the highest bishop in the Church, the highest priest in the Church. He is the *Summus Pontifex*, the highest priest on Earth. Like in ancient Rome, the *Summus Pontifex* was the highest peacekeeper, the one who built the bridge between two hills in Rome that fought each other, namely the Palatine and the Capitol Hill. He was the one who guarded the bridge which was the symbol of peace between two tribes that fought each other almost to extinction. And then they found that a religious solution might be a wise one, and they found the guy who built the bridge, which was the symbol of peace where they could say hi to each other instead of wiping out each other, and that was the pontifex, the priest. And the *Summus Pontifex* was the highest of them all. That is what the pope is. He's not Christ. He's not the founder of the Church. He's not even the head of the Church. He's the vicar of Christ. And ever since Gregory the Great, Saint Gregory the Great, the highest title of the pope is *Servus Servorum Dei*, the servant of the servants of God. The pope does a very bad service to you if he does not represent the Church doctrine in its entirety, and he does a very bad service to you if he lies to you about Church doctrine or the Gospel.

And I mentioned to you yesterday that in the *Constitutio Dogmatica Pastor Aeternus de Ecclesia Christi* of the 18th of July, 1870 at the First Vatican Council, in the fourth chapter it says, "The Holy Spirit has not been given to the successors of Peter so in order that with his revelation they can publish a new doctrine, but that with his assistance, they will saintly safeguard and faithfully interpret the tradition handed down from the apostles, the deposit of faith." That is the pope's duty. If he does not stick to this duty, you do not obey him.

Pope Pius IX, servant of God Pius IX, in a letter to the Bishop of Brixen in northern Italy, once upon a time in Austria... In those days, it was part of Austria. In this letter, which you can find on the number 5,500 something, forgot the rest, in the famous collection of papal letters and documents, Mansi, M-A-N-S-I, Mike, Alpha, November, Sierra, India. That's how you spell it. In that collection, number 5,500 something, you find a letter written by Pope Pius IX that explains to the Bishop of Brixen, "If a future pope was to pronounce heresy, you simply disregard it and don't obey." So far, Pope Pius IX on the topic.

## Heretical Popes in History and the Present Day

Now, we've talked about God. We've talked about the highest principle in the Church, because this is what you have to understand. The question is, aren't we not in disobedience to the pope because the pope would tell Father Bolduc that he will tell me that we have to celebrate the new mass, and we don't do it, and we will never do it over our dead bodies. Amen. So are we not in disobedience to the pope? Well, we are in disobedience to Karol Wojtyla, not to the pope, not to the highest principle in the Church. The pope is only the vicar of Christ. He's only the servant of the servants of God. He's really nothing else but that. If he fails to do his duty in this, I will not listen to him. I will not listen to a pope who proclaims heresy.

The present pope... And before anybody walks out on me now, you better hear and wait for my proof for what I say. The present pope is the most heretical pope in history. No pope ever in history was such a heretic. However, there were heretical popes before the present one. There were heretical popes before John XXIII, even. There was that funny little old pope, Liberius. When you look at the list of popes, for the first two centuries, all popes became saints. All of them. It is Saint Peter, *Sanctus Petrus*, *Sanctus Linus*, *Sanctus Cletus*, *Sanctus Clemens*, and so on. And then at a certain point you will find instead of *Sanctus* so-and-so, just simply Liberius. Liberius, period. That guy was a heretic. He joined in with a multitude of people and a vast majority of bishops at the time... sounds familiar... with the heresy that Jesus Christ was not really God Himself. I hate heresy. I have to have a gulp of wine with that. The church never said Liberius was not pope.

Then there was Honorius, another abominable creature on the throne of Peter, who said that Christ had only one will. If you really put your common sense to it, then you don't even need dogma to understand what I'm talking about and why he was wrong, because remember in Holy Week when it says, "Christ was obedient, obedient to his death." Obedient? With one will? Submitting one will to what? Impossible. Christ was, and is, the second person of God, divine will. And He is a full human being. There is no such thing as a full human being without a will, a free will. That's a difference to the most intelligent animal. The most intelligent animal does not have a soul, therefore not a will, and it doesn't have an intellect. It cannot reflect upon its own recognitions. The dolphin is known for being the most intelligent being around except for man. Some men are definitely more stupid than a dolphin, but basically a dolphin is the most intelligent animal. They have huge brains and they know how to put them to use. The military found out how, the Navy especially. The dolphin does not have the faculty of will, and it does not have the faculty of intellect because it cannot reflect upon its own thinking and thoughts. And I've never seen a dolphin painting or writing. All human beings do. The oldest human beings were the ones who painted in a cave. And Christ, as a human being, therefore had to have a human will, which is the only explanation for the otherwise absurd statement that Christ submitted to the will of God. How could Christ, not having a will, submit to the will of God? Impossible. Perfectly impossible. But this doesn't keep Honorius, who obviously was not exactly equipped with an IQ of 120, from saying Christ has only one will. That heresy was called monothelism, which is coming from the Greek term *mono*, one, and *thelema*, the will.

As if we didn't have enough heretics in Church history already, then came up John XXII, who was a frog, excuse me, a Frenchman, and he said that the souls of the dead cannot go to heaven before the Last Judgment. That means, what he was saying was, the moment a person kicks the bucket, the soul is suspended somewhere, who knows where, and you can't go to hell and you can't go to heaven before the last judgment. That's against the explicit definition, dogmatic definition, of the Fourth Council of Constantinople, which said, "The moment a human being dies, that human being will get the personal judgment from God. His soul will go to heaven, his soul will go to hell or purgatory." So now we got Saint Pius X in heaven, we got a lot of people in purgatory, and we got the democratic presidents and... Oh, sorry. I'm not allowed to mention individuals. We got a lot of people in hell. And John XXII, until the day of his death, insisted that the souls of the dead could not go to heaven before the last judgment. The University of Paris, which at the time was a good university, now we won't talk about it, told him, said, "Are you crazy? You can't say that." He said, "Of course I will say it. I'm the Pope." He even wrote it down. He wrote letters in which he said, "Well, we all know that the souls of the dead cannot go to heaven before the last judgment." The man was a heretic in writing and speaking until the day of his death. Yes, but when you look up the *Annuario Pontificio*, which is the yearbook of the Popes and the cardinals and the bishops in the church, it's a whole list of all the Popes that ever were, a close description of the present Pope, of all the cardinals, and then you get the list of all the real bishops and the auxiliary bishops, and then of all the Roman Curia. And in there, you will find John XXII listed among the Popes, and another guy, forgot his name, who cares, listed as Antipope. So the heretic is listed among the Popes, and the other one was maybe not even a heretic. It goes to show you that heresy alone does not make a Pope cease to be a Pope.

And yesterday, or the day before yesterday, with all the distinctions I gave you, by now you should also know why. Because John XXII did not say, "I am not the least interested in what the Council of Constantinople said on the subject. I tell you they were wrong and it's the other way around." No. He just said, "No, no, no, no. Don't come on. I don't want to hear this. The souls do not go to heaven before the last judgment." That's all he said. But he was wrong. He was pronouncing material heresy, but he was not a formal heretic because he did not want to put what he said in a direct, clear, published, and declared contradiction to church teaching. He personally was stupid enough to think that this was the way to interpret church doctrine. He did not want to change church doctrine. At least that is not to be proven. We have no proof that he wanted to change church doctrine. He thought that's the way to interpret it, and did not declare the intention of becoming a heretic.

This is the problem with the present Pope, except the present Pope is obviously not satisfied with one heresy like the other ones, Liberius, Honorius, and John XXII. No, for the present Pope, that's not good enough. He has to dwell in at least a half a dozen of heresies. I've just called the present Pope a heretic. If I don't give you the proof right away, then I am in the state of mortal sin, and you are not worth it to me to be in the state of mortal sin, if you understand what I'm saying. So you will get the proof.

When you say the creed, not the creed at mass, which is the long, the extended Constantinopolitan Creed, but when you say the Creed of the Apostles, you know what I'm talking about, the short creed, the Creed of the Apostles, you talk about Christ dying and descending to hell. That's what it says in the Creed. He descended to hell. Now, the term hell is not in discussion here. There's no question about it. We're not talking about the hell of the damned souls. We are talking about that part of hell, that non-heaven, to put it in politically correct talk, the non-heaven, where the just and the saints of the Old Testament in a perfect state of natural happiness were just waiting to be let into heaven. They've just been waiting there. It was a perfect state of happiness. So that's not the point. Now, church doctrine says the moment our Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross, his soul descended to hell because his body was in the grave. Death is defined as the separation of soul and body. That's the definition of death. Your soul and your body do not separate, you're not dead, period. So the moment Christ died, the council says, this is the Fourth Lateran Council in a dogmatic definition, dogma, the moment Christ died, his soul descended to hell because his body was in the grave.

Not so for John Paul II. He said on the 11th of January, 1988, "The line in the creed that Christ descended to hell is to be understood in a metaphorical sense, meaning that his body was laid in the grave while his soul, at the same moment, received a beatific vision." That is just ever so slightly opposite to what the council defined. If he says, I repeat, and I mean there's not even a political reason to say this, so this is what puzzles me. The moment Christ died, He descended to hell. That is to be understood in a metaphorical sense, because the body was laid in the grave, in the underworld, the grave, you know? It's below the potatoes, as we say, so the underworld, in the grave. "At the same time, His soul receiving beatific vision." This pope really never ceases to puzzle me, because in one line he pronounces a double heresy. The first heresy is that he says, "The fact that Christ descended to hell is to be understood in a metaphorical sense." That very formula has been condemned by Pope Pius X, and before him, Pope Pius IX, and before him Gregory XVI, who called such a formulation madness. That very concept has been explicitly condemned by Pope Pius X in his *Lamentabili* document. But anyway, because Christ was laid in the grave, the underworld, while his soul at the moment of death received beatific vision. So here he is contradicting directly, undoubtedly the dogmatic definition of the Fourth Lateran Council. At the same time he is contradicting sacred tradition. Do you, in all earnest believe it possible that the human nature of Christ in the same person as the second person of the Trinity would not have beatific vision from the moment of conception? The same person? Jesus Christ is the same person as the person, second person of God, the Son of God. They only have two different natures, but it's the same person. Now, is it that somehow in that same person the beatific vision just never made it into Christ human being? Or is it that the second person of God somehow ceased to have the beatific vision for a while? Well, both is blasphemy, heresy and absurd. The church never even bothered to make the issue of the beatific vision of our Lord Jesus Christ a dogma, because everybody would have said, "I don't need the church for that. I know that." If the human nature of Christ and the divine nature of the second person of God are united in the same person, how would it be possible, conceivable, thinkable that there's no beatific vision for Christ? But no, for John Paul II, he received a beatific vision on the cross dying. Great. That cannot be error, you see? That cannot be error, because even with the lousy cardinals and bishops in the Vatican around today, you can bet your life that somebody, at least the good old Cardinal Chapi, Dominican house theologian of the Pope, would have pointed all of this out to the Pope. I mean, this was printed in the *Osservatore Romano*. I'm not making this up. This was in the newspaper. And so many hundreds of people heard the Pope saying this in an audience, and the Pope is reading the *Osservatore Romano*. I mean, if he finds this in there and he doesn't like it, it's not sufficient for a pope to say, "I don't like this." He will have to call the editor and say, "Hey, what's the matter with you, bum?" But no, the *Osservatore Romano* for the last 20 years is packed with heresy almost every week once.

We get, just gave you another example. Now this is now, I mean, real, the writing of the Pope, his signature. I told you yesterday that it is not possible to be saved outside the church. You know that anyway. The Pope says that the efforts of the Protestants will be rewarded by Christ giving them salvation, so the efforts of the Protestants. For those of you who like to check on things, *Catechesi Tradendae* number 32 says, "*Spiritus Christi... Quorum ope Spiritus Christi non abnuit salutem ferre.*" For whose efforts the Spirit of Christ does not deny salvation. Okay? Whose efforts refers to the sentence before where they mention *Ecclesia Protestantia*. I don't want to go into the fact that to call the Protestant Church's churches is a heresy in itself, because it's secondary to what we are talking about. It's collateral heresy. But he says that Christ does not refrain from giving salvation to the efforts of the Protestant Church. I explained to you in my last presentation that even if the little innocent child dies and goes to heaven because he was baptized by a Protestant church, by a Protestant pastor, excuse me, by a Protestant pastor, that that Protestant pastor administered the Catholic sacrament of baptism illegally, illegally because a heretic and a schismatic must not do that. So that's not really Christ giving salvation to the efforts of Protestant churches, but it's Christ giving salvation according to his own promise to the Catholic sacrament of baptism, even though it was administered illegally. German idiom that I find brilliant. (German).You can insult God, but not diminish him. If God promised salvation for baptism, the Protestant pastor cannot take it away. But God does not give his salvation for the efforts of that guy. That is heresy. But there, again, the Pope is only quoting Vatican II.

Then the Pope says... Yesterday we talked about that. That tradition is something to be... That knows progress, and progress comes about through the studies and meditations of the faithful. We have discussed that abundantly well the day before yesterday, and there were no questions on it, so I don't have to mention it again. I gave you... Within something like 20 minutes, I gave you three examples of heresy in one and the same pope. I also mentioned the fact already the Pope says the moment Christ died, he saved all human beings, and he did not add the necessary term, "in potency." So the way it is written, as is, as you say, it is heresy.

Now why is it that if the Pope is a heretic, he's still pope? Well, that's one of the reasons why I mentioned the three examples before John XXIII. John XXIII was a heretic too, and so was Paul VI, but this is why I mentioned the three popes before. Liberius is recognized as pope. I mean, you can hardly get more heretical than by saying Christ was not fully son of God, was not fully God. Honorius is considered pope. It is perfectly stupid to say Christ had only one will, and yet Honorius did. He was considered pope. John XXII pronounced direct heresy and wrote it down against the Fourth Council of Constantinople, and he's considered pope. That's because it's not easy for somebody just to cease in his office. That's what I told you the day before yesterday. If I was to tell you heresy by mistake, you can bet your life on the fact that it was a mistake and not my intention to do so. I do not cease to be your teacher just because I made one mistake. If every teacher that made one mistake would cease to be teacher, there would be no teachers left on earth. I mean, look, this country now, thanks to the government, is in a pretty bad state of a mess. But you cannot even start to imagine the mess it would mean if a President of the United States would cease to be president, simply because he pronounces heresy against the Constitution, which he has sworn to uphold and protect and defend. If he ceased to be president just simply because he made a mistake in upholding, defending, and protecting the Constitution, then I think I have not the slightest idea how long the White House would be vacant already. Who was the first president to go against his duty to protect, defend, and uphold the Constitution? That's a nice question for historians. But surely this one is not the first. That goes without saying. So, the moment the president ceases to protect the Constitution, to uphold it, and to follow it, he does not cease automatically to be president. If he betrays the country, which the present president does all the time, if there is betrayal of the country, she does not immediately cease to be president. You have to impeach her. Now the only difference here is the Pope cannot be impeached. So if a pope was to proclaim heresy as a dogma defined with all the necessary formulas, the canon lawyers almost agree that he would just simply cease to be pope, the bishops would have to be called in to do something about it. But we're not sure about that because it never happened, and I don't believe it ever will happen, because then I would start to doubt about what the Holy Spirit was doing at the moment. Right? And we don't want that.

## The Pope as Schismatic

See, this present pope is not only a heretic, he's also a schismatic. Because I explained to you yesterday that Pope Eugene IV's favorite theologian, Cardinal Torquemada, Juan de Torquemada from Spain, said that the pope who was to attempt to change round all the sacraments and the Holy Mass put himself outside the church. Schism, therefore. Now the present pope, while in 1988 was kind enough, quote unquote, to issue that fraudulent letter, *Ecclesia Dei*, that says, "The bishops, please grant... Be a little bit more generous on granting old priests and those few unfortunate groups who don't understand the new doctrines, an easy access to the old mass." A year later, and this shows you how honest he is, a year later, and this is in printing, he said he finds it very hurtful that there are so many groups in the church that are still personally attached to the old forms of veneration. That means you and poor Father Bolduc and I are just a bunch of fools who personally or subjectively feel somehow emotionally attached to these outdated forms of worship. I mean, this in itself is schismatic... That is not the consecrations of bishops, that is a schismatic act. That is schismatic because by saying that, he says, in printing, he says that he doesn't give you know what about what the Council of Trent said, about what his predecessors said, about what Saint Pius V said, about what his predecessors did and upheld. But his predecessors represented the church as such. That is schism. That is cutting off the unity with the church.

Like when in *Redemptor Hominis*, 1978, his first encyclical, he defines the unity of the church as a unity of synods and episcopal conferences and parish councils and priest councils and diocesan councils. He does not once mention the unity of the church as it is dogmatically defined, a perfect society united under the same leader and united in the same faith and the same religion. That means the worship, the rites, R-I-T-A-S, the rites, the liturgy. No, he doesn't mention that. No, it's the parish council, parish Soviet, diocesan Soviet, priest Soviet in the diocese. It's the bishop Soviet in the country. It's the bishop Soviet on the continent, and it's the synod Soviet in Rome. Soviet means council, nothing else. A pope who defines the unity of the church as such does not know what the church is. He doesn't even know what it is. And this explains, at the same time, to you why he is a schismatic but doesn't cease to be pope. Objectively, he's a schismatic. He's not in unity with the church because he rejects what unites the church, namely liturgy and faith. He doesn't celebrate the mass. He celebrates a crummy new rite that belongs in the trash can, and he doesn't uphold the faith because he pronounces heresy. But at the same time, he doesn't know what he's talking about, quite obviously. That doesn't make him cease to be pope. That only makes the poor guy a heretic and a schismatic that God will judge, not you and not I. We do not judge the pope here, but we have to clarify our state in the church. When we say we do not obey him, we have to add the most important and vital distinction. We do not obey him as long as he's a heretic and schismatic. If we were to say, "We do not obey him, period," then we are the schismatics. No, we must be precise on that. I do not obey the pope as long as he's a heretic and schismatic. As long as the pope does not take his heresies back publicly, I will not listen to him. It's against the will of Christ. I will not obey his commands on that subject. No way. I do not obey illegal commands. If I was an officer in the United States Army, I would follow army regulations. I would follow, even if it hurts, and believe me, today it hurts more than ever, I would follow what my superior legally commands me to do. But if my superior was to tell me, "You will go to the Novus Ordo Mass celebrated by our chaplain next Sunday." I will say, "No, sir." In the army, he can't do anything about it. That's the difference. (laughs) In the conciliar church, you're finished the moment you say that. But obedience is subject to dogma, not the other way around. Obedience is never more important than faith. And if anybody says to you, "You're a schismatic," you say, "Uh-uh, not me. You." (laughs) "You go to a mass that's against the will of Christ. I don't. I go to Father Bolduc's mass. He doesn't do anything against the will of Christ." Of course, there are personal sins with Father Bolduc. There are personal sins that I commit, and we have to go to confession like anybody else. But what he does, not being Hector Bolduc but being Father, as it says out there on the note, Father, but being Father, what he does here is what the church wants.

## The Visibility and Indefectibility of the Church

You ask us, very often, people ask me about the visibility of the church, the indefectibility of the church. How come with all this mess we got we can still talk about the church being visible and indefectible? Next Sunday, I'm going to celebrate the high mass, and Father Bolduc will celebrate the low mass. The Sunday after, Father Bolduc will celebrate both masses. Whatever you see, it is of not the slightest importance. If it is Dr. Hesse or Father Bolduc celebrating up there, who cares? The important thing is what we do up there. Is the church visible? You see the church because you see that in a pretty much similar way, not all too identical, but pretty much similar way, we come out here with the chalice, we genuflect, we go up to the altar, we start *in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*. It's the same, basically. What you see, you find in your missal. You got your Sunday missal. Your Sunday missal doesn't say, "Latest edition, 1998, spring." (laughs) Something like that. Your Sunday missal says, "1962 and earlier." So your Sunday missal dates back to the old days. There is no such thing as a 1998 spring missal. (laughs) Well, in the Church of the New Advent out there, you have a 1998 spring edition, 1998 summer edition, 1980 fall edition, so on, as you got it with a quarterly newspaper or magazine. If I want the writing 1998 spring on something, then I prefer *The Veranda Magazine*, which is, by the way, beautiful, beautiful, and something like that. But not with a missal. A missal represents the Church eternal, the Church here. And in a way, even though the Church will cease to be as such at the last judgment, there is something as the Church eternal, the Bride of Christ, that cannot die. In St. Patrick's Cathedral, with the loudspeakers on the pillars and the TV monitors there, so you can follow the beautiful happenings upfront. That is not the Church visible. That is heresy visible. That is Neo-Protestantism visible. That is the Church of the New Advent visible. Who said it's the Church of the New Advent? Pope John Paul II in his first encyclical. That is the conciliar church visible. Who calls it that? Pope John Paul II in his first encyclical. Who does not speak about the Roman Catholic Church or the Catholic Church in his first encyclical? John Paul II in *Redemptor Hominis*. But here, in this church, and later on, if you are good enough to help, in the church over there, you will see the Church visible. And there, you will see the indefectibility of the Church, much better than you could see it in the 1950s. You know all the trouble, all the battles, all the fights, the priests like Father Bolduc and I had to go through? Church teaches? That is the indefectibility of the Church visible. See, even that vast majority of bums, even those, the North American Episcopal Conference, those criminals out there could not keep us from teaching what the Church teaches. If that is not indefectibility, then I don't know what is. The Church, as such, is indefectible. But the indefectibility of the Church does not mean that all of the members are all right.

A certain Doctor Martin Luther got quite confused in the 16th century when he found out that the pope who reigned between 1490 and 1503 had children. He was scandalized. I'm talking about Pope Alexander VI, who had children while he was pope. And Martin Luther made a terrible mistake, he said, "The Church is not indefectible. The papacy, therefore, does not represent the Church. The papacy is not infallible, because an infallible pope could never, ever have children." I don't see the logics. The fact that I would have the Holy Spirit guaranteed to me if I was a pope does not make me impotent, excuse me if I name it in these terms. And it certainly does not make me cease to be a sinner. And the Holy Spirit does not lock the doors to the papal apartments. The Holy Spirit does not keep a morally degraded woman from approaching the pope. There's no logic in that. It has nothing to do with the indefectibility of the Church. It has nothing to do with the fact that the Church is a perfect society. The Church has never said, "We have only perfect members." You know that there were priests and bishops who said, "Only the perfect members are members of the Church"? Do you know that that was condemned as a heresy? (laughs) Jansenism and Donatism, two heresies. In the old days, when the understanding of the Church was much better than now, whoever said that the Church can only have perfect members was a heretic. The Church is composed of an awful lot of sinners. But as such, it is indefectible and a perfect society.

## Answering Specific Questions

Now, this brings us to some of the questions that were asked today.

### On Michael Davies and the Novus Ordo
One of the first ones being Michael Davies... You know Michael Davies, I guess. Yeah. Michael Davies says that since the Church is indefectible, it could not come up with such an abomination as the Novus Ordo. The Church never came up with the Novus Ordo. The Church didn't. A traitorous, non-believing, schismatic pope came up with the new Mass, namely Paul VI of most infelicitous memory. He had the new Mass written up by a Freemason named Bugnini. He published the new Mass against the will of the Church, but not even he managed to give his signature to a document that would oblige you to use it, or me. The Church indefectibility has never been touched in the least by the fact that that abomination of the Novus Ordo was published. Michael Davies suffers from a partial new heresy that we have been warned about in the 1920s, when a certain Abbé Laroche, French priest, said, "Now that Pius X has effectively dealt with the heresy of modernism, we are going to face the worst of all heresies, and that is the heresy that says that the Pope can do anything," one of the most common heresies in the United States of America.

Americans are law by nature, by education. They are the best-educated people in the world. I know what I'm talking about. Don't run down your country or you will run on the fighting side of me, like Merle Haggard, "Haggard Sings," exactly like that. Don't run down your country. Run down your government in eternity. They deserve it. Don't run down your country. There's a difference. Your government does not represent your country. Your government sabotages your country. Your government is about to make your country perish into the United Nations. Your country... your government is about to destroy, and absolutely destroy this country. But in this country, people are still the most polite and well-educated people in the world. They have what is called good manners. They have what is called civilization. If you don't believe me, waste your money on traveling abroad, and you'll be in for a lot of surprises, I tell you that. So at the same time, there is no coin without two sides. There's always two sides to a coin. You have been taught to obey the law, and that is the cause for a lot of papalism in this country. Many people in this country are not capable of distinguishing between the lawful authority of the Pope and his dictatorial omnipotence. Well, there is no such thing as a dictatorial omnipotence with the Pope. The Pope tells you to dye your hair green, you will say, "Ha, ha, ha, good one." (laughs) So the Pope is not in the power to tell you things that are not backed by the church government, by the church tradition, and by the church teaching, on morals especially. And papalism in this country is one of the major causes for so many people attending that boring, stupid, idiotic, and imbecile rite called the new Mass. This does not change the indefectibility of the Mass. Therefore, when Michael Davies fights the district superior of the Society of Saint Pius X in Australia publicly in that abominable paper, *The Remnant*, then Michael Davies is wrong, and the district superior in Australia is right. The new Mass is bad in itself. And I explained this to you in my last session.

### One Pope Over Two "Churches"?
So then, if we have a new faith and religion since Vatican II, can we have one pope over both? That is a very good question. Yes. Who keeps the pope of the Holy Roman Catholic Church from being at the same time the president of a stupid club? I mean, think about it in logical and realistic terms. Does the papacy exclude automatically, infallibly membership in a stupid club? No. (laughs) Where does it say so? No dogma says that. (laughs) No, no pope ever said that. I mean, look, in the old days, the bishop of the Diocese of So-and-So, was it impossible for him to be at the same time the member... not only member, but the president of the Democratic Communist Veteran Club of the local place? No. What would keep him from doing so, except a good conscience? Nothing. He doesn't cease to be bishop because he belongs to some idiotic institution at the same time. Right? And I told you that we have a pope who pronounces one heresy after the other, and he doesn't cease to be pope. Why would he cease to be pope if at the same time he heads a Novus Ordo United Nation B'nai B'rith Jewish masonry club called the Church of the New Advent, a neo-Gnostic sect? He can be, well, the elected Vicar of Christ and at the same time the guy in charge of some rascal members of a rascal organization.

### Do Numbers Mean Anything?
Does the number mean anything? See, this is another one of those arguments. They tell me, "Oh, Father Hess, I know Father Hess..." Yes, Father Hess, you are right, and 2,800 bishops are wrong. (laughs) Yes, that's exactly what it is. (laughs) That's exactly what it is. 3,500... I don't know how many we got right now. 3,500 bishops are wrong, and I'm right. So what? At the times of Pope Liberius, a couple of hundred bishops were wrong and Athanasius was right. Who got the S before his name? Athanasius became Saint Athanasius, Liberius and his crony bishops didn't. And I'd rather be one of the last few hundred members of the Catholic Church than one of the one billion members of the Church of the New Advent. If numbers decide who is right, then I can tell you who is right. The Muslims are. (laughs) They have the most members. Right? One and a half billion people can't be wrong. (laughs) So our god is Allah and Muhammad is his prophet. Numbers do not count before God. God said, "Few will make it. Many are chosen. Few will make it." Excuse me. "Many are called. Few are chosen." I'm not saying I'm the chosen one. I just give you the truth here. If I make it to heaven, you'll find out after the Last Judgment if I made it. But you definitely can rest assured about the fact that I will try my very best to give you what I have received, *quod tradidi vobis*, as Archbishop Lefebvre said all of his lifetime.

### Validity of Other Sacraments?
Are there serious questions regarding the validity of other sacraments? Yes. So. If baptism is administered on the highway in a case of an emergency, with dirty water, and a Muslim that you had for dinner the night before and who is now disposed towards you, and who will baptize your child that you just wanted to get to the parish to be baptized, the Muslim can do it if he has the intention to make you a favor, to do you a favor, if his intention is to do what the church would do in such a case, which means his intention is to do what the church does. I'm representing church teaching, mind you. If he grabs the water, you're in there in a car, you can't move. He grabs the water and he pours it over the child's head saying, "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." He's definitely administering valid baptism. But if the local parish priest ignores the books, sometimes if he doesn't ignore the books, most of the times if he ignores the books that have been issued legally, and says, "All that talk about original sin is really a lot of baloney. We don't have to get rid of original sin because there is no such thing as original sin. The whole purpose of baptism is to make you a member of our beautiful community." Then even if he uses water and the right formula, he will not baptize validly. That's a dogma. Because Leo XIII defined dogmatically that if somebody out of his own will and his own decision and against the law leaves out essentials in the rite of the sacrament, even if he has the intention to do the right thing, cannot do it anymore. So baptizing today sometimes is indeed invalid because you get enough screwballs around who would act exactly the way I just did.

The Sacrament of Confirmation today is practically invalid all over. Not only because Paul VI granted them to use vegetable oil, peanut oil, and similar atrocities that no elevator or car would ever accept as sufficient. For baptism, when for 2,000 years the only valid matter was olive oil. Also, the new form of confirmation is, "Accept the Holy Ghost," or, "Accept the Holy Spirit." That's not sufficient. It doesn't mean anything. You accept the Holy Spirit in all seven sacraments. It's impossible to receive confirmation validly if it only says, "Accept the Holy Spirit." Leo XIII says that in the same document I mentioned before that condemns Anglican ordinations. Okay?

Then, if you take confession, if the priest in confession does not say, "I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit," but says to you, "Well, see, what you tell me here is all very interesting but it's not really a sin, so go home in peace." Or if he says, "Well, Christ our Lord would absolve you of your mistaken actions..." Politically correct speech, there's no sin, it's a mistaken action. "In the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit," you leave the confessional without absolution. Invalid sacrament. He has to agree to the sins confessed and absolve them with the necessary minimum of formula, which is, "I absolve, I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and the Son, and Holy Spirit."

We discussed already the validity of mass. Then, with the ordination, we discussed that too. I gave you the example of that Dutch bishop who was not consecrated by the Dutch cardinal, and which had a fact that needed a conditional repetition of the whole rite. And then with extreme unction, if you run around with a bottle of Superveg 2000, best for your salad, for extreme unction, it won't work because again, there's the olive oil to be used. And if a priest says, instead of giving you the extreme unction says, "I'm going to make sure you will get healthy again," there's no sacrament. They do that all the time, things like this. You won't believe what happens. I told you about the priest in Switzerland. No, this is a real happening. I don't make up things like this. My fantasy's not good enough for the things that actually happen, believe me. Facts are stranger than fiction. And there was a priest who said, instead of the words of consecration, he said, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the prettiest of them all?" Then he had the most beautiful girl present elected as the queen for today's mass, and they went all down to the swimming pool that's under the sanctuary. No kidding. That happened in Zug in Switzerland. Z-U-G you spell that. In Zug in Switzerland, 1975, and the local bishop was all too happy to be present. So, I told you that Blessed Pope Benedict XI said, "You in no way may approach doubtful sacraments." So, I do not have to prove to you these sacraments are invalid. It's completely sufficient to prove to you it's doubtful. You may not go there.

### Where Does the Present Church Exist?
Going through the questions again, where does the present church exist? Does it only exist at present in the Saint Pius X Society or with the faithful of ?
As Saint Athanasius once said, "No. The Catholic Church exists in two ways. The visible objective way." In the visible objective way, the Catholic Church exists wherever the pope is not denied and the old mass is celebrated. Objectively visible way. That means as a group, the society of Saint Pius X is the only one because as a group, it's not objectively in heresy. I told you the Fraternity of Saint Peter and the Institute of Christ the King are objectively in heresy, and I told you why. Objectively, I repeat that. That's important that you understand that. Objectively. Not the individual priest. Objectively. The society as such, not the individual priest. Okay? That's very important to understand. The individual priest very often does not represent what he belongs to. One of my best friends, among all the priests in the world, is a member of the Institute of Christ the King. He's no heretic. When I asked him, "Is there a possible way to interpret Vatican II in a Catholic way?" "No," he said. And I told him, I said, "Would you ever accept the Novus Ordo Mass?" He said, "Yes, over my dead body." (laughs) So the individual does not represent the group. But if the group makes a seminarian sign, or makes a seminarian sign that Vatican II is all right, or kicks out a teacher who speaks against Vatican II, then the group is wrong. Period. So in the objective, visible way, the Society of Saint Pius X is one of the few groups in the world that are representing or representative of the Catholic Church.

But then, you see, Father Bolduc is not just an individual who runs his own business and whatever like that, but he is a priest of the Catholic Church, and he does not have to prove that to you, because you would have to prove to him that he's not. And you certainly can't do that, because he can easily prove to you that he represents the church in his personal opinions, as in his teaching, as, and this is very important for the visible Church, his actions up there. You confess with Father Bolduc, you get Catholic doctrine in the confessional. You get the Catholic sacrament of confession, because he will follow the old rite in the absolution. You approach him for baptism, you get the Catholic sacrament of baptism, with the exorcisms for the child. Exactly. With the exorcisms for the child, with the necessary consecration of the child, with the chrism tradition. And that makes the church visible and makes him automatically a visible member of the church, as I am. Because you ask me questions. I give you the answers the church gives as much as I can. And you ask me for a sacrament, you will get what the church granted you as a dogma by divine right. Remember, I talked about it. That is objectively the church.

Subjectively, we cannot pronounce judgment. Subjectively, there might be a heretic sitting here. I hope not, but might be. Subjectively, there might be somebody sitting here who says, "All of what Father Hess says is very interesting, but I don't believe a word." In which case, you don't believe church doctrine, which I'm representing right here. Subjectively, we cannot pronounce judgment. Subjectively, you cannot say Mrs. So-and-so who goes to the Novus Ordo every Sunday is not a Catholic. Well, maybe she isn't. Maybe she doesn't know better. Maybe she just has had the bad luck of being born imbecile, or she might have the bad luck of never having met Father Bolduc, or she might have had the bad luck of never meeting any one of you who's capable of explaining what you heard here. You can't judge. You don't know if she belongs to the Catholic Church or not. Who belongs to the Catholic Church subjectively? There's only one who knows. Three persons know it. Father, Son, Holy Spirit. I'm not even sure how far Our Lady knows these things, because as we know from the apparitions in Fatima, Our Lady is not informed about everything. Our Lady does not know when the last judgment will take place. Christ said that. Christ said, "Only the Father knows." That means Father, Son, and Holy Spirit know, of course, but God knows, and only God knows many things. And among those things that only God knows is the present state of the soul of Father Bolduc, Father Hess, and all of you. It's very nice and kind of you if you think that Father Bolduc and I are presently at the state of grace. Father Bolduc may think about himself that he's in the state of grace, and so do I. But only, only God knows. You cannot know. I cannot know about him. He cannot know about me. And if I ask Father Bolduc to hear my confession, he hears what I say. He does not know if it's the truth that I tell. He presumes. And I won't lie to you anyway, so. But only God knows that. So where does the church exist? Only where you see it. Period. Here, you see 8 o'clock in the morning, 8:30 on Sunday, 6:30, 6 and all these ungodly hours. (laughs) But there you see the church. You see the church. And if God wills and Father Bolduc does not die, and I do not die, and Sister does her job, you might have me here for Easter next year, and then you will see the church, and you will see the glorious old church, how it was before the popes messed it up. That is where the church is, where you see it. Does it only exist present in the Society of Saint Pius X? No, I answered that. It exists where you see it. And the Society of Saint Pius X priests will be certainly careful in not telling you anything else. They might be kind of partisan for their society. That's fine. They have to be. But they will not tell you, "The church does not exist outside our society." Some of them might think that, that's bad enough, but they will not tell you that. 'Cause if they did, they would be in heresy.

### Schism and Not Being Under the Local Bishop
We are told that we are in schism since we are not under the local bishop. Would that not put us in the same position as the Russian Orthodox, valid but illicit?
It would if it were true. (laughs) Oh, yeah, sure. It would if it were true. We are under the local bishop. We just have to refuse his commands because they come from the wrong corner. They do not have the authority necessary, not because he's the local bishop but because he's not a Catholic and does not follow Catholic doctrine and Catholic tradition. Just as I said before, why is it that Father Bolduc and I are not exactly in perfect harmony with the present pope? Well, because the present pope is not exactly in perfect harmony with church teaching tradition and even the tradition of canon law. A pope who speaks heresy, commits schismatical acts, and knows nothing about canon law is not exactly the man to issue an order form to me. And this is the same, and in a worse way even for the local diocesan bishop. He's a personal friend of the local bishop, but you surely, hopefully will not do what he says. And even less what he does. So, schism needs the rejection of the authority as such. If anybody says to you, "You are in schism, you're not under the local bishop," you give him the right answer, which starts with the words B-U-L-L. And then you tell him, "The one who is in schism here is you because you attend a mass that is against divine will and law, while I follow the church tradition and therefore follow the will of Christ. And your bishop, the bishop you just mentioned, does not follow the will of Christ and does not heed Christ's wishes. So the one who is in schism is you, not me. Bye." If he doesn't want to listen. But please be always kind, always charitable, and always nice, and infinitely patient with those who want to listen. One of the problems of traditionalists in this country is that very often they are real die-hard arrogant people. (laughs) I hate that. If somebody comes the usual innocent way, "Excuse me, Father, but the way I see it, you're really in schism." And then I say, "No, Madam, that is not the case." And she says, "Why?" Then she will get my attention and patience and patience and patience and patience. And please be patient with them. And if you can't answer the question, then say, "I'll talk to you later. I'll look it up. I do not know everything. Only God does." Then you look it up. Either you ask Father Bolduc, and if for some, he's not omniscient either. Only God knows everything. Then you look up my tapes. I'm not omniscient either. You don't find the answer on my tape, you keep looking. And then maybe one day you can come back to that friend of yours and say, "Now I found the reason for what I was saying." But be patient with them. Only if they say, "You are in schism and I'm not going to talk to you anymore." Say, "Thank God. Yes, please keep your promise." (laughs)

### Monsignor Pell's Letter and Ecclesia Dei
There's a letter from Monsignor Pell that I'm asked to answer. Monsignor Pell is the secretary of the commission called *Ecclesia Dei* based on that fraudulent document that I discussed the day before yesterday, so it's a fraudulent commission. How fraudulent it is you will see with my reading two paragraphs to you.
"The Society of Saint Pius X has consistently denied that the excommunication took effect, excommunication of Archbishop Lefebvre." I explained that to you. And so on. "As to the priests of the Society of Saint Pius X, the church has not thus far made an authoritative declaration in their regard. It is clear that they are suspended, that it is forbidden by the church law to celebrate the sacraments because of irregular ordination and so on. We must strongly counsel against participating in the masses," well of course what else? And then, "With such an attitude, the Society of Saint Pius X is effectively tending to establish its own canons of orthodoxy, and hence to separate itself from the magisterium of the Supreme Pontiff." You know, the most boring thing about the Society of Saint Pius X is that they never came up with anything new. They follow church tradition, and with one exception against patriotism, which I have mentioned the day before yesterday and have indicated today, you will not get anything but church doctrine from them. And if anybody of those, any one of those priests says something contrary to church doctrine to you and you denounce him, you will be effective. I can guarantee you that because I'm a personal witness to that.
"According to the Canon 751 of the Code of Canon Law, such refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or the communion with members of the church subject to him constitutes schism." The Society of Saint Pius X refuses communion like I do with heretics and schismatics. They do not refuse communion with the Bishop of Green Bay because he's the bishop of Green Bay. They do not refuse communion with the Archbishop of Milwaukee because he's the archbishop of Milwaukee. They refuse communion with him because he's schismatic. See, but these people, they try to confuse you by deliberately omitting those distinctions.
And then they say, "A further point of law is that since the priests of Society of St. Pius X do not enjoy the faculties of the diocese, any marriage at which they preside are invalid, and likewise, the absolution which they impart in the Sacrament of Penance is also invalid." I've talked to you about that. I told you why these are not invalid. We're talking about a state of emergency, the new arch-heresy. It's a state of emergency and you cannot approach any one of the priests in Green Bay or Milwaukee or similar for the sacraments because all you will get is the Novus Ordo baloney, including the moral theology involved. And the poor girl who is just about to marry will maybe have to learn how to paint with her fingers, but she will not learn anything about the Sacrament of Matrimony. Under those circumstances, it is impossible to approach a priest like this because you're not allowed to approach heretics or doubtful sacraments. At the same time, by divine law, it has been granted to you that you have a right to the traditionally handed down liturgy in the Catholic Church of the Roman rite, the Roman Latin Rite. At the same time, we have a right to approach a priest for the sacraments. So if you cannot approach these people and the only one around that will guarantee you really the correct moral theology that is involved in confession, the correct education about marriage that is involved with that sacrament, and the only one so far around is Father Bolduc, you have to go to Father Bolduc. You can't choose, because the only other priest in the area is Fraternity of Saint Peter, and I've talked about them, I hope, abundantly clear, but you will be able to ask questions on that. So... And then, of course, regarding marriage, I mentioned the Canon 1116. Even the new Code of Canon Law, which these people know but do not talk about, even the new Code of Canon Law grants you to marry without the local priest for sufficient reason. And if heresy is not a sufficient reason, I wouldn't know what is (laughter). So commenting on this abominable standard, by the way, standard, they photocopy it and send it to everybody who bothers them. This standard, lying, fraudulent letter from a lying and fraudulent priest whom I had the doubtful pleasure of knowing myself, should not keep you from believing what you say. Monsignor Pell's letter does not represent Church doctrine, it does not represent Church tradition, it does not represent the new Code of Canon Law, and it even less represents divine law. As a matter of fact, it is in perfect contradiction to such. And while the Society of St. Pius X, like any society in this world, is packed with human beings who make terrible mistakes, and while you might have an unfortunate encounter with a member of the Society of St. Pius X, who I guarantee you are not all saints, then please remember the fact that in the so-called good old days, like in the 1930s or the 1880s or whatever, I can guarantee you that any local bishop would have been exceedingly happy if his clergy had the average level of the Society of St. Pius X priests. And Father Bolduc, who was once a member of the Society who is not anymore, will certainly agree with me on that point. The average, amen, the average of the Society priests is high. And we can't expect more than that. We never in history were able to expect more than that. The average of the diocesan clergy in the 1950s was a major disaster. They were not like now, perverts who, who know what, I don't even want to mention it, but the average was disastrous, believe me.

### Communion of Saints and the Conciliar Church
And, so there, the last question, then I will let you ask questions. "Can one belong to the communion of saints if you're not in the conciliar church?"
Only then. Inside the conciliar church, there's no salvation because it's outside the Catholic Church. Outside the Catholic Church, there's no salvation. Period.

## Questions and Answers from the Audience

**Question:** Father, what do you mean when you say that the new mass is actually against the divine will of Christ?
**Answer:** Have you been here the day before yesterday? Okay. As Pope Eugene IV's house theologian, the Council of Trent, and Pius V and all of his successors agreed on the fact that no new liturgy can be written up, invented by a commission of people that also had six Protestants as members cannot be but against divine law.

**Question:** I know that in the old Code of Canon Law it mentions a lot about not being a Freemason if you're a Catholic. In the old Code of Canon Law there is a paragraph that says if you are member of the Freemasonic rite, you're excommunicated. In the new Code of Canon Law, it does not mention that. Still, were there absolute rules or anything?
**Answer:** In the new code of canon law, there's a paragraph that says, "If you belong to an institution that is explicitly against the church and you're excommunicated, an excommunication reserved to the Holy See." However, the observation is very accurate and necessary because in the new code of canon law, it does not define anymore who is against the church. And as the constant stupidities of ecumenism today are really confusing people about who belongs to the church, who is part of the church, and who is against the church, I consider this one of the most dangerous aspects of the new code of canon law. Because many people will say, "Okay, I'm only a low-degree Freemason. I've never heard my lodge pronounce anything against the church, so why shouldn't I be a member?" And according to the new code of canon law, they would not even be culpable in that case. The new code of canon law basically is the best part of the conciliar church, but it's still liberal and dangerous.

**Question:** So, what about Freemasons is bad?
**Answer:** Objectively, the Freemasons are enemies of the church. They still hold to the old doctrine of Voltaire who said, *Écrasez l'infâme*. "Erase the infamous." Meaning the Catholic Church. Many and majority of Masons will deny this to you, but then their code of honor says you must. So, there cannot be any doubt that objectively speaking, whoever belongs to the lodge is an enemy of the church, and as such, excommunicated. But with the new code of canon law, this has become something rather vague.

**Question:** If I understand you correctly, a traditional independent priest does not need jurisdiction?
**Answer:** A very good question. I've been asked if a traditional independent priest does not need jurisdiction. Of course he does, but the church grants this jurisdiction because if you study canon law on the subject of jurisdiction granted by the church, first of all, it's pretty easy to remember. You have to remember the canons with 44 at the end, 944 and 344 and 144, something like that. In those canons, there are several things mentioned. First of all, in an emergency, the church will confer jurisdiction. That was in the old code, too. Somebody dies in the street, even a publicly excommunicated priest may administer the sacrament of confession, validly. Church grants jurisdiction. Somebody is a priest on a ship. On a ship, you cannot choose. There might only be one priest, unless it's a pilgrimage to Rome for a clergy group. Then jurisdiction, any priest on the ship has automatic jurisdiction. If we... With that Novus Ordo Church out there, if we are not in a sinking ship... I mean, in a ship, and the sinking ship as such, I don't know who is or who has ever been. Then, in the situation of error, *error facti*, the jurisdiction's granted. And the church is very generous on that and always has been, because otherwise the church could not have possibly said that the Russian Orthodox have jurisdiction. The church recognizes the validity of Russian Orthodox confession and marriage. That would not be possible because marriage and confession, as it rightly says in the questionnaire here, are dependent on jurisdiction. So I do not receive my jurisdiction from my archbishop in Vienna or my actual bishop in Australia. I receive my jurisdiction because if one of you approaches me and says, "Father, can you hear my confession?" You're not coming up because you find me such a lovable person or movie star, but because you face a traditional priest who will give you what the church gave me. Therefore, you just follow the divine law-granted right to the old rite and approach me. And you approach me or Father Bolduc because nobody else around. If that is not an emergency, then what the hell is an emergency? Of course we have jurisdiction, but this jurisdiction is not granted by the local bishop who is not a Catholic anymore. It is granted by the church that will always be Catholic. *Ecclesia supplet*. *Ecclesia supplet*, the church supplies for what we do not get from the rightful authority.

**Question:** I find it a lot easier to make a good Act of Contrition since my *Seder Actum*, the Act of Faith, Hope, and Charity. And then my question is that how does the church stand on cremation?
**Answer:** I don't understand your comment. What do you mean it's easier for you to do an Act of Contrition? Instead of going to confession? No. So in order to make the Act of Contrition, to make a good Act of Contrition, you almost have to say the Act of Faith, Hope, and Charity slowly so that you don't want to cry.
The perfect Act of Contrition does not mean that you get into some state of ecstasy about the abominable sins that you committed, but an Act of Contrition is nothing else but realizing and having the intention of not committing sins anymore, and feeling sorry for the sins that you committed, not because you're deadly afraid of hell. That is an act of attrition. But because you offended God, who is the first object and the first person of your love, the first three persons of your love. The act of contrition means, you do not want to sin because it offends God. You are sorry for your sins because they hurt God. They at least hurt Jesus Christ on the cross 2000 years ago. Your act of contrition means, you love God that much that you really are not interested in the fact of you might go to hell. You do not want to offend God. That is the priority, and that means an act of contrition. But many people only go to confession because they're deadly afraid of going to hell. That cannot be contrition. That is attrition. You realize that your life is in permanent eternal danger, and you avoid that by just consuming the sacrament, so to speak. The act of contrition means you realize that you are in disharmony with God, and you want to get back into harmony with God, not because it hurts you, but because it hurts him. Never forget that love does not know the word I.
And then the second question was, how about the church about cremation? That's not a dogma. The reason why I detest Paul VI's decision that you may have your bodies burned if you like, is because of a lack of respect. See, Paul VI did not have respect for anything but himself. He showed that, and he made that abundantly clear. Paul VI was a blasphemer who said, "Glory to man in the highest" when Neil Armstrong... calling the mass as something as having a character of a meal, which is heresy. So Paul VI had no respect for anything, and he said, "Okay, you want your body burned? Go ahead. Enjoy yourself." Instead of saying, "That is something to be left for public emergency." In the old days, if there was a plague and you had all the corpses lying around, that is a dangerous thing. In that case, the danger in public good is more important than the respect for the body. Like you always have been allowed under church law to dedicate your body for medical research because that helps benefits mankind. But it's a lack of respect to have your body burned after your death, just for the heck of it.

**Question:** The other one was, donation of organs. How does the Church feel about that?
**Answer:** Church has always agreed with it. How can you find out what the heart is like if you do not dissect it so you can donate your body to something? Then, the moment you're dead and somebody else's life depends on getting your heart, which is the only part left in your body that still works fine, maybe, then why not? The same Pope Paul VI who understood so little in many other things, understood moral theology very well when he sanctioned, positively sanctioned the emergency case of those poor people who had crashed with their plane in the Andes in South America, and survived because they only ate the flesh of their dead travel passengers. They did not kill them in order to survive. That's murder. They just cut up their bodies and survived eating. Well, listen, I might be too fat, but that's not the point. But I'd be happy in my hour of death realizing that some other people around me could only survive eating me up. I'd be happy to tell them, "Don't forget the salt and the pepper." (laughing) The public good stands above the respect for the human body. But to ignore the respect for a corpse just because of personal preference, that is not acceptable to the church.

**Question (rephrased from initial comment):** On confirmation, do you want to say anything? *(The speaker then discusses the validity of the New Mass, likely mishearing "confirmation" for "consecration" or relating it to the changes in sacraments.)*
**Answer:** Well, I can only repeat what I said the day before yesterday. I've just been asked if Father Bolduc mentioned several times the fact that the words of the consecration of the chalice have been changed in the new Mass, and therefore the question arises if the new Mass is valid or not. I told you that I cannot prove if it is valid, and I cannot prove if it is not valid. I can only prove to you that it is doubtful, that the very fact that these words have been changed make the validity of the new Mass doubtful. And Pope Benedict XI, Blessed Benedict XI said, "You must never approach doubtful sacraments." That settles the practical question. As for the theory, I repeat, many theologians say the mass would still be valid, but then the Roman missal says it's not. The part of the Roman missal that speaks about it is not dogma, but the theologians who say it's valid are even less dogma. So I only believe it's not valid, but I can only prove to you that it is doubtful.

**Question:** When I talk with the, when I talk about the Latin word magisterium... *(rest of question inaudible)*
**Answer:** When I talk about the Latin word *magisterium*, I'm talking about something that is defined as everything the popes have decided in extraordinary magisterium dogma or ordinary magisterium, that's their encyclicals and letters and bulls, about how tradition is to be interpreted and understood. That is the magisterium. The magisterium contains, therefore, all the papal decisions that are non-contradictory to each other, all the papal decisions on how to understand the gospel, on how to understand the oral tradition of the church, and how to understand the 10 Commandments. I think that's pretty much in a nutshell.

**Question:** Would you explain how people are losing their faith in the churches?
**Answer:** Well, I did yesterday, before yesterday, explain that by saying, "As the new Mass (audio cuts out) nation of the faith, the new Mass does not represent the faith in its entirety. As a matter of fact, the new Mass deliberately leaves out essential parts of the church doctrine on the Mass and on salvation and many other things. The new Mass as such, not by circumstances." This is what Michael Davies doesn't understand. The new Mass as such will by and by lead you off the faith because you believe what the mass says, not the other way around.
