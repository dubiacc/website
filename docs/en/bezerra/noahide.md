# Vatican II, Noahide Law, and the Third Temple

**Introduction:** This article is a transcription and translation of a conversation between Dr. Hogan (Dr. Deep State), Professor Carlos Bezerra, and a translator (likely Fred) discussing the connections between the Second Vatican Council, the implementation of Noahide Laws, and the push for a Third Temple in Jerusalem, viewing these events through a lens of theological and historical analysis.

**Dr. Hogan:** Hello everyone and welcome to Dr. Deep State. We are very, very excited today. We have a presentation entitled Vatican II, Noahide Laws, Third Temple with Professor Bezerra.

**Professor Bezerra:** Thank you very much, Dr. Hogan. It's a great pleasure to speak with you. I have been following your channel, Mr. Deep State, for some time now with deep interest, and I perceive that there are connections between what you say on your channel and what I have been saying for some time on my channel and in my apostolate.

**Translator:** Professor is saying that he follows your channel and many things that he says, he also collects information from your channel, which is a source of news.

**Dr. Hogan:** Well, likewise, I find that your take, your take on events is singular in the world. So when you speak, I listen. I find you to be right on these events and especially what we're going to talk today: Vatican II, Noahide Laws, and the Third Temple. All of those together. I think you are the authority in the world on those. And before we continue, I will of course link to Professor Carlos Bezerra's channel here. And it's not hard nowadays, there are different knobs you can push, whether you want to AI voice translate or to read the subtitles. But I highly encourage everyone to check out his work because of the times we're in and the events that are unfolding.

**Professor Bezerra:** Did the professor get everything?

**Translator:** Yes, most of it, yes.

**Professor Bezerra:** And so, first of all, I would like to start by apologizing. I am having a problem with my voice. It's a problem that has been diagnosed as spasmodic dysphonia. It's a problem that affects the ability to speak, and that's why my voice comes out this way. I'm undergoing treatment; it's not a cure, but it helps at least minimize the effects of the illness.

**Translator:** But he has been suffering from a spasmodic uh dysphonic spasm or something like this. And he is under treatment now and his voice is not so good.

**Dr. Hogan:** Yeah. So, um, we had another guest on here. These gentlemen are from the Catholic Center of São Paulo. They are Brazilian and they speak Portuguese. So one of the ideas that we're going to try to string together is between Vatican II, Noahide Law, the development right now of the Third Temple. There is a new Pope, obviously. One thing I would suggest just to kind of string these things along, and I would go back to even an informal document from 1965, kind of a prelude to Vatican II, the words of, in particular I would say, I would go to even a document from um 2013, Pope Francis' Evangelii Gaudium from 2013. What I see here, from Vatican II to Evangelii Gaudium to the new pontiff, what I hear is the word "discourse" coming out. And the word "discourse" is, every time we meet to discourse, there's a fancy word, I don't want to talk too fast here, sometimes we call it, um, by the way, again, the links will be in the Locals. Mondays we have Metaverse Mondays, we were talking about this just on Wednesdays, we do Connect the Dots, and tomorrow will be the Deep Field Friday. But when we pull these things together, we have a fancy word we call the apophatic negation of reality or of being. So when full being, full being or authority is critiqued, and that's done through dialogue, so every time pure being, which is the Church, because we're talking about the enmity between the Church and the Synagogue, every time the Synagogue comes up and we have dialogue, whether in a Vatican II document or the document of 2013 and the ones on the horizon, the dialogue always leaves the Church with less being and more of a *sila* (emptiness). And so this is my real concern here with this ongoing, and so the current pope seems to be speaking out of two sides of his mouth, recognizing the Church as being the true Israel, but yet more dialogue. So to me there is this the revolution continues, continuing a push back... anything?

**Professor Bezerra:** Please. See, the problem of the Second Vatican Council is much deeper than is usually assessed. And it's true. Yes, the Church has always had its enemies, and from the beginning, the enemies of the Church are what our Lord Jesus Christ Himself called the Synagogue of Satan.

**Translator:** Sorry. Yes, Professor is saying that the Vatican still have problems for a long, long time. But I forgot. Sorry, I missed.

**Professor Bezerra:** Yes, I was saying that the problem of the Vatican is deeper. And because the enemies who manipulated the Second Vatican Council are the same ones from 2000 years ago. That is, the Synagogue of Satan.

**Professor Bezerra:** And yes, and therefore, what we saw in the pontificate of Pope Francis was a continuity with everything that was determined by this Council.

**Professor Bezerra:** And to understand this, we need to understand that there was indeed a plot against the Church, as stated in the book with this very name, which was written by a group of priests and signed under the pseudonym of Maurice Pinay.

**Translator:** (Mentions the book title or author)

**Professor Bezerra:** Yes. Is that better?

**Translator:** OK.

**Professor Bezerra:** OK. So, and I was saying that to understand this, it is necessary to understand it within a context, of a plot against the Church.

**Translator:** And it's a plot. Exactly. This book, this book.

**Professor Bezerra:** Well, having said that, we begin to understand what really happened. So, the Second Vatican Council is the culmination of this plot against the Church.

**Translator:** Vatican II.

**Professor Bezerra:** Unfortunately, the bishops who were present at the council sessions were not prepared for this. However, the enemies were very well prepared for this.

**Professor Bezerra:** Well, this final assault against the Church began to take shape at the end of the Second World War.

**Translator:** War.

**Professor Bezerra:** The first point was in Nuremberg, at the Nuremberg trials. Second point, at the Carlsbad conferences in 1947.

**Translator:** Nuremberg trial. 1947.

**Professor Bezerra:** And here a very important character enters this story, named Jules Isaac.

**Translator:** There is a very important character, Jules Isaac.

**Professor Bezerra:** Jules Isaac was a secularized Jew.

**Translator:** Secularized.

**Professor Bezerra:** Of the type, of the type of the Jewish *Haskalah* philosophy, which secularized Jews there in the second half of the 19th century.

**Translator:** From Haskalah. How would I translate this? From Haskalah.

**Translator:** Tradition.

**Professor Bezerra:** Jules Isaac, like so many other people, suffered with the Second World War and lost family members, lost loved ones.

**Translator:** Jews.

**Professor Bezerra:** Nevertheless, Jules Isaac came to have a conception of history – he was a history professor – in which he formally accused the Catholic Church of what happened to the Jews during the Second World War.

**Translator:** as that happened, Jules Isaac.

**Professor Bezerra:** Jules Isaac was the main engine of this plan that would culminate in Vatican II.

**Translator:** Jules Isaac. Vatican II.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, Dr. Hogan, the entire Second Vatican Council was promoted, financed by these forces with the objective of promulgating a final declaration called Nostra Aetate.

**Translator:** So Dr. Hogan, all of this was financed with the drive to promote at the end of the Vatican, the declaration Nostra Aetate.

**Professor Bezerra:** So see, since Nostra Aetate could not be declared at the very beginning, at the opening of the council, they left it for the end of the council.

**Professor Bezerra:** For this to be possible, Cardinal Augustin Bea met with the American Jewish Committee in New York.

**Translator:** So to make this a possible thing, Cardinal Bea and the AJC got together.

**Professor Bezerra:** And it was behind the scenes that the entire strategy of the council was defined.

**Professor Bezerra:** Now, for the Nostra Aetate declaration to have final approval, it was necessary to dilute Catholic doctrine through the New Theology.

**Professor Bezerra:** And at this point, most analysts of the Vatican Council miss a bit of the larger issue involving the council, the larger context involving the council, because they focus too much on the issue of the New Theology, but forget to see the larger backdrop behind the council.

**Translator:** for being, being.

**Professor Bezerra:** Well, because the Nostra Aetate declaration needs to be seen within this broad context.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate, seen in a large range.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because the history of Nostra Aetate begins 2000 years ago.

**Professor Bezerra:** The first point is that Judaism, as we know it today, is not the religion of the Hebrew people or the people of ancient Israel.

**Translator:** Ancient Israel.

**Professor Bezerra:** No, the religion of Judaism is based on a deeply dangerous racialist conception for humanity.

**Translator:** This religion, the new Jewish religion is based on a very dangerous thing to humanity.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this religion takes into consideration some stages that need to be achieved.

**Translator:** Set stages.

**Professor Bezerra:** The first stage,

**Translator:** First stage,

**Professor Bezerra:** And the Catholic Church is considered Edom.

**Translator:** Catholic Church.

**Professor Bezerra:** And for the messianic era to begin, it would be necessary for Edom to repent of its history.

**Translator:** (Untranslated term likely related to repentance or conversion)

**Professor Bezerra:** And it was necessary, therefore, that Edom, or the Catholic Church, publicly ask for forgiveness.

**Professor Bezerra:** The first formal act of this public request for forgiveness was precisely the promulgation of the Nostra Aetate declaration in 1965.

**Translator:** asking for forgiveness, Nostra Aetate declaration in 1965.

**Professor Bezerra:** This thus inaugurates the process of the messianic era, the final process of the messianic era.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, and for this to become possible, it was necessary to instill in the collective consciousness of the Church a complex of guilt.

**Translator:** processing guilt.

**Professor Bezerra:** This complex of guilt occurred through a process of monumental historical falsification.

**Professor Bezerra:** And from this falsification of history, which was done through massive propaganda by the media, empowered by 20th-century techniques,

**Professor Bezerra:** and the media exerting intense psychological pressure on the bishops during the council.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the fundamental point of the council that unfortunately triumphed was the subversion of the Doctrine of Substitution.

**Translator:** So the winning thing was the doctrine of substitution that ended, reached the final stage through the doctrine of substitution.

**Professor Bezerra:** We know, by Catholic doctrine, that on the cross our Lord fulfills the prophecies of the Old Testament.

**Translator:** Old Testament.

**Professor Bezerra:** And that from that moment on, the Old Covenant was undone.

**Professor Bezerra:** And thus begins a New Covenant that will last until our Lord returns.

**Professor Bezerra:** This is the Doctrine of Substitution.

**Professor Bezerra:** And yet, the Second Vatican Council, by accepting the Nostra Aetate declaration,

**Translator:** the Nostra Aetate declaration.

**Professor Bezerra:** It puts an end to the Doctrine of Substitution because it affirms that the Old Covenant remains in force.

**Professor Bezerra:** Now let's look at the consequences of this. If the Old Covenant remains valid, then the central question of the new religion of Judaism, which is based precisely on the negation of the Old Testament, is not understood.

**Professor Bezerra:** If the Old Covenant was not revoked, then what is the reason for the coming of Jesus Christ?

**Translator:** Yes.

**Professor Bezerra:** And, and therefore, it is considered that the Jewish people remain not only dear to God but as a salvific mission for humanity.

**Translator:** So you consider that chosen people.

**Professor Bezerra:** And that's where the so-called religion of Noah comes in.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, Dr. Hogan, the Nostra Aetate declaration opens the doors for the implementation of the Noahide Laws.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate opens the doors.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because this is the second phase, the second level. The first level is for Edom to ask for forgiveness. The second level is for Christians and other peoples to accept the superiority of the Jewish people and submit to the Laws of Noah.

**Translator:** Acceptance of the old covenant still valid, and the second is to implement this. I have just lost because it's deep, the Noahide Law.

**Professor Bezerra:** While you speak, Professor.

**Professor Bezerra:** And from this, the Catholic Church is transformed into what Rabbi Benamozegh called the Catholicism of Israel.

**Translator:** Example.

**Professor Bezerra:** The Catholic Church should merely... the Catholic Church should merely promote universal fraternity.

**Translator:** Meaning...

**Professor Bezerra:** That is, the Church would have only a naturalist purpose. And the spiritual part is in charge of the Jewish people.

**Translator:** Jewish people.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, for this to be possible, the Second Vatican Council defined as strategy two stages. The first, a stage called *ad intra* (Latin). In Latin, *ad intra*. And the second, *ad extra*. The *ad intra* stage refers to the relationship of the Catholic Church with other Christians.

**Professor Bezerra:** For this, the document *Unitatis Redintegratio* was promulgated. And the strategy used was based on the following terms: the conception of the Church as the People of God, and also the conception of *elementa Ecclesiae*.

**Translator:** *Unitatis Redintegratio*. And the conception of elementa Ecclesiae.

**Professor Bezerra:** This strategy was carried forward, especially in the pontificate of Pope Paul VI.

**Translator:** Paul VI.

**Professor Bezerra:** It is called Restricted Ecumenism, and it had even been condemned by Pope Pius XI in the encyclical *Mortalium Animos*.

**Translator:** Called Ecumenism, restricted. Encyclical *Mortalium Animos*.

**Professor Bezerra:** The second stage would only be effective after the first stage was completed.

**Professor Bezerra:** The relationship of the Church with other religions, the *ad extra* strategy, which was made effective by Pope John Paul II.

**Translator:** On John Paul II.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this *ad extra* strategy is what is contemplated in the Nostra Aetate declaration.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate declaration.

**Professor Bezerra:** And therefore, what was seen at the Assisi meeting in 1986 is the beginning of the Catholicism of Israel.

**Translator:** Seen in 1986 meeting at Assisi is the beginning of Catholicism from Israel or Israel Catholicism.

**Professor Bezerra:** Well, from the moment the Catholic Church accommodated to this, one can move to the next phase.

**Translator:** Catholic Church.

**Professor Bezerra:** Which is wars for the reconstruction of the Third Temple. Which is exactly what we are living today.

**Dr. Hogan:** Let's shift to the Third Temple. I'm going to go slow in pieces.

**Translator:** Professor Hogan will change now, the ideas, he will change the focus to the Third Temple. He will speak in blocks so I can translate in small blocks, so I can translate. So, OK.

**Dr. Hogan:** was inversion of the reality of the church that understood, that built the church, the enmity between the church and the synagogue, the de- being, and the collective guilt. So what that does together is builds this mindset. So before I ask the question, I just want to maybe have you um translate...

**Dr. Hogan:** Document number 247, quotations from Vatican II. And what Professor Bezerra just said, "We hold the Jewish people in special regard because their covenant with God has not been revoked. The gifts of God are irrevocable. Romans 11:29." And I'll repeat that. It's reasserting this ambiguity from Vatican II, and it's explicitly stating that the covenant is not broken. So just before we continue, let's pull, I just want to pull that together. It's opening up the Old Testament and the, and it's negating the finished work of Christ on the cross and the finished work of 70 AD, the destruction of the temple. That's probably too much. Do you want to summarize some of that, Professor?

**Professor Bezerra:** Yes.

**Translator:** The Professor understood what he said? All?

**Professor Bezerra:** No, only a little.

**Translator:** He says that the Nostra Aetate declaration is de facto the door that opens so that there is a negation that the old alliance, the ancient covenant, it continues to be valid. And he even quoted the biblical passages that, where this is supposedly placed, right? It is placed there. So he says that he perceives that this is the opening for the new religion of the Jews, right? Of the Jewish people. OK.

**Dr. Hogan:** So we are at this level that Professor speaks about, and um I want to include the Third Temple. And recently Professor Carlos had a discussion. I'm going to go slow and ask two questions here. Number one, translate immediately. Number something.

**Translator:** Question number one. He has some ideas in depth. The idea that there will be a precondition for the Third Temple.

**Translator:** If you agree that the elimination of the people of Palestine would be one of the preconditions for the Third Temple?

**Professor Bezerra:** Concordo. (I agree)

**Dr. Hogan:** I'll frame this in brief before I ask the question. Just today there are these policies that have been released from the Heritage Foundation Project Esther, and Project... let me get this... Project 2025. I know that's a lot of information, but it's going on at once. Project 2025, Project Esther, and Heritage... any ethnic cleansing is going to be part of an international network of terrorists. This is kind of an aside, but I find this significant in terms of the framing the consciousness of the world. So it was inversion.

**Translator:** OK. He is saying that all this preparation that is happening with the... the Jewish Foundation and all these controversies that are happening now, also with the AJC, and including this last event that happened, that we talked about before. Uh-huh. If it is... he is putting this in order to ask the question, OK? If the... and he will now ask the question.

**Translator:** I have explained that what you have.

**Dr. Hogan:** So these are the times we're living in. I have a question about one of Professor's recent videos.

**Translator:** Of Professor's recent videos...

**Dr. Hogan:** ...There has been over at least a decade comment about the red heifers.

**Translator:** The red heifers.

**Dr. Hogan:** One of the things that the Professor commented was including this gathering of Jews near the Dome of the Rock. Up to 130 people together entering the Dome of the Rock. In what terms can we take this?

**Translator:** Near the Dome of the Rock. Up to 130 people together entering the Dome of the Rock. Uh-huh. In what terms can we take this?

**Professor Bezerra:** So, in that region since the Ottoman Empire, there was a restriction on the number of non-Muslims in that Temple Mount area. However, in recent months, we have seen that the Israeli police, who are in charge of the security of the Temple Mount, have allowed the violation of this ancient law. Which ultimately means that there is already a principle of accommodation in that temple area, with a view to the actual construction of the Third Temple there.

**Translator:** So this means that there is a certain settlement or accommodation in the area as for the Temple.

**Professor Bezerra:** And on the other hand, there is no reaction from the international Islamic community to this. There is a very clear reason. The Muslims demand Europe.

**Translator:** Europe.

**Professor Bezerra:** At this moment, the only real obstacle to the construction of the Third Temple is indeed Iran.

**Translator:** Iran.

**Professor Bezerra:** The problem with Palestine is already resolved with the total destruction of Gaza. The problem with Syria is resolved with the occupation of Damascus.

**Translator:** Gaza. Syria, Damascus.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the issue with Iran remains. This is in terms of the wars for the construction of the Temple. The practical issue for the reconstruction of the Temple, they already possess all the elements.

**Professor Bezerra:** As for the role of the Catholic Church in relation to this, recently, Rabbi Reulei Smulevich sent a document to the Holy See, which was received by Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

**Translator:** Rabbi Reulei Smulevich. Cardinal Pietro Parolin.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this document is a kind of means for the Church to recognize that the current people of Israel have the right to this inheritance of those lands, as a divine inheritance.

**Translator:** This document states that those lands belong, over they are the divine lands.

**Professor Bezerra:** Ah, in other words, this document would be a kind of final complement to Nostra Aetate.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate.

**Professor Bezerra:** Can you hear me now?

*(Audio issues and translation interruption)*

**Translator:** Can you hear me now?

**Professor Bezerra:** And now it's better?

*(More audio issues)*

**Dr. Hogan:** Something is sounding something here. Sorry about that. You probably are listening to me, but I can't hear you. Something went wrong. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Please.

**Translator:** Yeah, yeah. Now I can. OK, sorry.

**Professor Bezerra:** Can you hear now? OK, OK.

**Translator:** OK, OK.

**Professor Bezerra:** So this document is a kind of final complement to Nostra Aetate.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate.

**Professor Bezerra:** And here, Dr. Hogan, enters the importance of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.

**Translator:** Chabad-Lubavitch.

**Professor Bezerra:** Dr. Hogan mentioned the document Evangelii Gaudium, right, which was promulgated by Pope Francis, if I'm not mistaken, in 2014, right? Which deals exactly with this recognition. They really like to use keyword phrases, right? "Bridges," "dialogue," when in reality, what there is is submission.

**Translator:** Dr. Hogan has mentioned Evangelii Gaudium, and this Professor is saying that's exactly where they use the words that they so much love: bridges, dialogue, and so on.

**Dr. Hogan:** Yeah. Let me interject quick. Um, in this document, Evangelii Gaudium, Evangelii Gaudium 2013, at the end of um number 247, it concludes according to... this was a question that was in... let me, let me just go short. I want to make sure I got this. In reference to the relationship between the Church...

**Translator:** In this document, I think in number 247, there is a reference to the Court of the Gentiles.

**Dr. Hogan:** The Court of the Gentiles. A curious phrase. It couldn't be talking about the previous Temple according to AI when it's entered. Um, and by the way, thank you Jacob for um... According to AI, that is about dialogue with the Chabad-Lubavitch to promote Noahide Covenant and encourage non-Jews to follow its principles.

**Translator:** According to this, he thinks it's a dialogue with the Chabad-Lubavitch people so that these Noahide laws can be implemented.

**Professor Bezerra:** Exactly. Exactly.

**Translator:** Exactly.

**Professor Bezerra:** If Dr. Hogan allows me to make a small digression to explain a little about the Chabad-Lubavitch movement... The Chabad-Lubavitch movement is a movement of Hasidism, typically from White Russia, where Ukraine is today.

**Translator:** White Russia, Ukraine.

**Professor Bezerra:** And therefore, for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, Ukraine has a fundamental importance. And something few people know is that due to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement considering its leadership, the Rebbes, as manifest expressions of divinity,

**Translator:** Rebbes. Divinity.

**Professor Bezerra:** Ukraine is also considered by them as a holy land.

**Translator:** Ukraine. Holy land.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because it is the original land of the seven Rebbes.

**Translator:** Seven Rebbes.

**Professor Bezerra:** Chabad was in fact the engine that drove the great revolutions that shook Europe in the 19th century.

**Translator:** 19th century.

**Professor Bezerra:** It acted, especially the first Rebbe, on the issue of Napoleon's defeat.

**Translator:** Napoleon.

**Translator:** Napoleonic Wars.

**Professor Bezerra:** Early 19th century. Oh, okay. Then the Chabad-Lubavitch movement migrated to New York.

**Translator:** Early 19th century. New York.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the importance of the seventh Rebbe...

**Translator:** Seventh Rebbe. And this most important.

**Professor Bezerra:** Ah, first, in catalyzing the Jewish people into the awareness that they must bring the Messiah.

**Translator:** And that made a sort of catalyzer of the Jewish people.

**Professor Bezerra:** Second, to disseminate the Laws of Noah to non-Jews.

**Translator:** Noahide Laws to non-Jews.

**Professor Bezerra:** And for this, they send emissaries to all parts of the world. The Laws of Noah are an invention of the Talmud.

**Translator:** Laws of Noah are an invention of the Talmud.

**Professor Bezerra:** According to the Talmud, Noah would have committed a repetition of Adam's sin.

**Translator:** Adam's sin.

**Professor Bezerra:** However, with a good intention. He wanted, in reality, to understand Adam's sin to redeem humanity. And for this, he goes to drink the fruit of the vine, the wine, right?

**Translator:** Drink.

**Professor Bezerra:** And for this reason, humanity falls again.

**Professor Bezerra:** On Sinai, with Moses, the Jewish people are redeemed by the Laws of Moses and become subject to the Laws of Moses.

**Translator:** Sinai mountain. Moses Laws. Moses Laws.

**Professor Bezerra:** However, the rest of humanity remains subject to the Laws of Noah.

**Translator:** And the rest of the humans are subject to Noahide Laws.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this separates humanity into two humanities. A priestly humanity, and that has in itself particles of divinity...

**Professor Bezerra:** and the other humanity is that...

**Dr. Hogan:** I can't hear you.

**Translator:** I can't hear you.

**Professor Bezerra:** I could hear you.

**Translator:** No, yours is the one with the problem.

*(More audio issues and attempts to fix)*

**Translator:** And uh Professor Bezerra can call here by phone, by Signal, and I will hear here and speak to Dr. Hogan.

**Translator:** Professor Carlos' microphone is off.

**Professor Bezerra:** OK. And now can you?

**Translator:** Now. Now yes.

**Professor Bezerra:** Now yes. OK. OK.

**Translator:** Now yes. OK.

**Professor Bezerra:** We have to go back because I practically didn't catch anything from your answer.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, and the other part of humanity, that is, the non-Jews, has no connection with the divine. And therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authority of the priests.

**Translator:** Priests.

**Professor Bezerra:** And therefore, Dr. Hogan, the Laws of Noah are not as simple as they seem. Because they depend exclusively on the interpretation of the rabbis.

**Translator:** Rabbis.

**Professor Bezerra:** However, two of these laws, the first two, are radically against Christians.

**Translator:** Against Christians.

**Professor Bezerra:** And we know that it was established in the Talmud and was disseminated by Ramban... Maimonides... that the violation of one of these laws implies the death penalty by decapitation.

**Translator:** Maimonides. Decapitation.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this explains why this system of decapitation was used in the French Revolution.

**Translator:** And this also explains why this decapitation, beheading people, was used through the French Revolution.

**Professor Bezerra:** This is because Freemasonry knows this perfectly well.

**Translator:** Freemasonry.

**Professor Bezerra:** Since Freemasonry was created with this purpose,

**Translator:** Crep...

**Professor Bezerra:** That is, to disseminate the Laws of Noah.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the Laws of Noah, as I said, the first two are anti-Christ.

**Translator:** Anti-Christ.

**Professor Bezerra:** It is impossible to be a Christian and follow the Laws of Noah. Because being a Christian implies the recognition of the divinity of Christ.

**Translator:** Divinity of Christ.

**Professor Bezerra:** And in my understanding, from the moment the Third Temple is rebuilt, the Jewish Sanhedrin will claim an international court, and it will most likely be a substitution for the UN.

**Translator:** Sanhedrin. UN.

**Translator:** Sanhedrin.

**Professor Bezerra:** Including this principle has already been demonstrated with a letter the Sanhedrin sent to President Donald Trump.

**Translator:** And this is clearly shown through the letter that the Sanhedrin had sent to the president of America, Donald Trump.

**Professor Bezerra:** To establish a divine international tribunal.

**Translator:** Asking to be recognized as a divine international court.

**Professor Bezerra:** And here, Dr. Hogan, it seems very clear the work that the Rebbe Schneerson did with the North American presidents.

**Translator:** The size and the type of work that has been done that the Rebbe... Rebbe Schneerson has done with the American presidents.

**Professor Bezerra:** From Jimmy Carter, Reagan, Bush, up to Donald Trump.

**Translator:** From Jimmy Carter, Reagan, Bush, up to Donald Trump.

**Professor Bezerra:** Ah, the whole thing boils down to a conception of knowledge or fulfillment of prophecies.

**Professor Bezerra:** We know that the entire Old Testament is fulfilled with our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Translator:** Old Testament. Jesus Christ.

**Professor Bezerra:** However, if Nostra Aetate and other post-conciliar documents recognize that the Old Covenant remains in force, then implicitly it is recognized that the prophecies are still to be fulfilled.

**Translator:** Nostra Aetate. So if, if we recognize Nostra Aetate and previous documents, if we recognize the Catholic Church recognizes, it means that those prophecies are still not fulfilled.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because they were not fulfilled in Jesus Christ, but will be fulfilled in the Jewish people together.

**Professor Bezerra:** This even involves an idea of a redeeming sacrifice. Not of Jesus Christ, but of the Jewish people themselves.

**Translator:** And this also goes through the idea of a redeeming sacrifice.

**Professor Bezerra:** And thus the Jewish people assume their eschatological and theological protagonism in history.

**Translator:** So the Jewish people would really fulfill or assume their eschatological and historical. Wow.

**Dr. Hogan:** Okay, I have kind of two maybe final questions and maybe I could ask them at the same time.

**Translator:** Two questions. He wants to ask at the same time.

**Dr. Hogan:** One just fell out of my... Let's go back to the 1992 meeting. And the idea of prophecy was... that this had to happen in his lifetime. What do we make of that? Is that part of the... and of the strange decisions? And I guess I have three questions. So what do you make of the, you know, the imperative that this had to happen in Netanyahu's lifetime? And, and the idea, like a prophecy of sorts by Henry Kissinger, that Israel will disappear. Of course, it's been stated that that a third of the people gathered have to be eliminated for this um this [umat?] (community). I'll let you translate whatever you can remember.

**Translator:** OK, OK, OK. He's talking about the meeting of Benjamin Netanyahu and the Rebbe Schneerson in 1992. If this prophecy about the Third Temple really has to be fulfilled during the life of these people, of Do-don't know or if we are going to see something related to Henry Kissinger that I will ask him to repeat so I can tell you.

**Translator:** Can you, can you that thing about Henry Kissinger, please?

**Dr. Hogan:** Well, it corresponds with other cabalistic prophecies that the people gathered must be uh at least it's usually a third, sometimes I've heard two thirds, but a third must be eliminated, and that would be part of the sort of the scapegoat.

**Translator:** If it would be necessary a sacrifice of a part, one, he has heard that it's a third, sometimes two thirds of the Jewish people in this gathering that have to be sacrificed.

**Dr. Hogan:** in a way, like, are the policies... Is that one way to make sense of the insanity of Israel's policy right now? That they're inviting this...

**Translator:** If they are bringing an apocalypse upon themselves through the attempt to fulfill this prophecy, this elimination of a third or two thirds of the Jewish people.

**Professor Bezerra:** Many believe that this was fulfilled in the Second World War.

**Translator:** 6 million.

**Professor Bezerra:** Exactly.

**Translator:** Yes.

**Professor Bezerra:** OK. There is an idea that needs...

**Professor Bezerra:** Noahide Law was divided and was complete in our Nostra Aetate. Yes. And the question of the Third Temple, I think Benjamin Netanyahu, he fully incorporated the idea that this must be accomplished with him.

**Translator:** Yes. And the, the, the question of the Third Temple. Benjamin Netanyahu has this idea that this thing of the Third Temple, the construction of the Third Temple, must be fulfilled during his lifetime.

**Professor Bezerra:** It is very, very likely that he heard this from the Rebbe himself.

**Translator:** He probably has heard this from the Rebbe himself.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the Rebbe, he had reasons to say this, because the main obstacle against this project had already been fully removed in 1992. Remember that this is exactly the year that the new Catechism of the Catholic Church was promulgated.

**Translator:** Catechism of the Catholic Church.

**Translator:** Catechism was promulgated in 1992.

**Professor Bezerra:** And the new Catechism, it recognizes that the Old Covenant remains in force and also recognizes the obligation to submit to the covenant with Noah, or the Laws of Noah. No, it is not explicit, but it is understood.

**Translator:** 1992. And the new Catechism, the 1992 Catechism, it really recognizes that the Old Covenant is still valid and it recognizes that we have and shall obey Noahide Laws. So it is in there.

**Professor Bezerra:** So I think that from that meeting with the Rebbe, Benjamin Netanyahu established as a goal to faithfully fulfill this to the ultimate consequences.

**Translator:** He believes that after meeting with the Rebbe in 1992.

**Professor Bezerra:** Now, as for the question that they will attract a punishment upon themselves, I have no doubt about that, because...

**Translator:** As they are attracting some punishment upon themselves, he says he has no doubt about it.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because they intend to build the Third Temple to resume sacrifices. However, it is not like the sacrifices made in the ancient temple. It will not be this way.

**Professor Bezerra:** In the Old Covenant, sacrifices were for the atonement of sins and prefigured the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.

**Professor Bezerra:** However, since they are Kabbalists, they intend to make sacrifices to have dominion over God, to control divinity. It's what the Greeks called Theurgy.

**Translator:** Greeks. Theurgy.

**Professor Bezerra:** The result of this can only be catastrophic for all humanity.

**Translator:** Theurgy.

**Professor Bezerra:** Theurgically, they are trying to generate the time of Christ's Passion with substitution. When the Pharisees whipped the people. We must become aware of this. It's a difficult question.

**Dr. Hogan:** ...inaugurated and the synagogue in as a direct force of the church right now. But the anti-church has been inaugurated. Let's say, I guess, one way we could say it is the times we're living in, it seems to be the finality of something and the beginning of something else. How does he want to approach this, perhaps frame it very well?

**Translator:** Which is in the... which is in the... Professor Bezerra understood that he is saying that with Nostra Aetate, the anti-church was inaugurated, and he wants to know what the Professor thinks about these coming times that we will live, if it is indeed an inauguration of the anti-church. And what does the Professor have to say about this kind of thing?

**Professor Bezerra:** I, I, the first thing I say is that all of this is prophesied in the Apocalypse by our Lord Jesus Christ and by Saint Paul.

**Translator:** Apocalypse. Our Lord Jesus Christ. Saint Paul.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because there are some conditions, preconditions, for us to truly enter the apocalyptic era. The first precondition would be that the Gospel had been preached throughout the world. The second, the second precondition, obviously, could only occur after the first, the apostasy of the nations and the clergy themselves.

**Professor Bezerra:** Considering everything we have said here in this broad context of history. And its theological implications. And we can conclude that the 20th century was the century in which this second part was consummated, that is, apostasy.

**Professor Bezerra:** As warned by Popes Leo XIII and St. Pius X.

**Translator:** Leo XIII and St. Pius X.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because they warned about this at the turn of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

**Professor Bezerra:** Because, obviously, these first two preconditions having been fulfilled, we must necessarily reach the third, which is the coming of the Antichrist.

**Translator:** Antichrist.

**Professor Bezerra:** And therefore, Dr. Hogan, I believe there is no possibility of return anymore. We have reached that point beyond the possibility of return.

**Dr. Hogan:** Okay. I'll do one final. What does Professor Carlos Bezerra think about where...

**Translator:** With regard to the advancements that are occurring in artificial intelligence, what does Professor Bezerra think about this?

**Professor Bezerra:** So, we are marching rapidly towards an ever-greater process of dehumanization. And obviously, this has a Kabbalistic purpose. Ah, because according to the Kabbalistic doctrine of rectification, or *Tikkun*, it is necessary to dehumanize man.

**Translator:** Tikkun.

**Professor Bezerra:** In order to make sin a form of redemption. It's like a deep immersion. And the final purpose of all this is the total enslavement of the entire human race.

**Translator:** Enslavement.

**Professor Bezerra:** It's a terrifying scenario, like in the worst dystopias of Hollywood movies.

**Translator:** Scary scenario from the most unusable scenarios from Hollywood movies. It would be something like completely dystopic.

**Dr. Hogan:** Yes. So, um, okay. Before I tie it up, um, I agree that this is part of *Tikkun Olam*. It seems that in the Book of the Apocalypse, the Mark of the Beast, I've interpreted as we trade in our image of God for the image of man. Somehow we don't know, AI is probably part of, you know, the image and so forth. Does Professor want to make one final comment? It seems to be our last act of free will to give up with that.

**Translator:** Would it be possible for a comment on this exchange of God for artificial intelligence being indeed our last act as free humanity?

**Professor Bezerra:** Here in Brazil, there was a very interesting author named Gustavo Corsão.

**Translator:** In Brazil, an author, a man called Gustavo Corsão.

**Professor Bezerra:** He wrote a very interesting book called "The Century of Nothing".

**Translator:** The Century of Nothing.

**Professor Bezerra:** referring to the lies of the 20th century. He ends the book by saying that if the history of humanity begins with Original Sin, the end of history will certainly be with the final sin or terminal sin.

**Translator:** Original sin. Final sin, terminal sin.

**Professor Bezerra:** The Original Sin that initiates history is the sin similar to that of Lucifer. It is the sin of naturalism. It is when sanctifying grace is rejected, and it is affirmed that one's own nature is enough.

**Translator:** Grace. Nature alone.

**Professor Bezerra:** It is man wanting to be God himself by his own nature.

**Translator:** God.

**Professor Bezerra:** This sin of naturalism returned to humanity with full force with the humanism of the 15th century. And it triumphed in the Vatican Council under the doctrine of Integral Humanism of Maritain.

**Translator:** Humanism. It ended, I mean, it fulfilled this coming through the doctrine of human... humanism and its doctrine. Jack Maritain, Jack Maritain's doctrine.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this doctrine takes from God what is due to God to give to man. It puts man in God's place. And the terminal sin will be the dehumanization of man himself. Man wanting to be more human, with the focus of this humanization on his own freedom.

**Translator:** God. Dehumanization. Freedom.

**Professor Bezerra:** And this unrestrained freedom is what will lead to the terminal sin or the dehumanization of man.

**Translator:** Dehumanization of man.

**Dr. Hogan:** I can't help myself. I'm going to ask one last question. We talked about pulling it together: Vatican II, Noahide Laws, the Third Temple. And um, when we talk about um sacred scripture, it talks about um the apocalypse, the end times, "it will be like the days of Noah". There's many interpretations about genetic modification was going on and a lot of crazy stories. What I heard Professor say fascinated me, that this was sort of the um this, this was sort of the initiation of this movement, of this naturalist movement following the serpent in an organized way. So the inception of this at the moment of Noah... it's getting long here. So when we go back to scripture and it says "as in the days of Noah", and then we see in a sense that the birth of the Noahide laws, yes, it really takes off with Maimonides, but there is this birth moment, this cycle that they're trying to enact. If I frame this properly, could you try to maybe can make sense of that?

**Translator:** Did the professor understand everything?

**Professor Bezerra:** No, only one point.

**Translator:** OK. He is talking about the birth of the Noahide laws, that he knows it has to do with Maimonides. And this temporal thing. If the professor could give a last comment regarding this part of Noah, of the Noahide laws, in relation not only to Maimonides, but to the core of all this.

**Translator:** I'm talking about... Not sure if I translate it correctly.

**Translator:** Inspiring the scriptures say... the return to Noah, if what is happening now is not a circle that will return to this piece...

**Professor Bezerra:** It is the execution of what was started, repeating the sin of Adam. So, the problem is that you have the doctrine exposed by revelation in Holy Scripture. And then you have the adulterated interpretation of this doctrine. It is true that God established a covenant with Noah right after the flood. But this does not mean that there is a separation between two humanities. This is the doctrine that makes this distinction between two humanities, a divine humanity and an inferior one; it is a doctrine of the corruption of revelation. And it is also true that, just as the world was punished in Adam's time due to sin having spread so much, in Noah's time, and the world was punished for this, certainly there will be, before the Parousia, the Second Coming of Christ, a new punishment. But the principal cause is apostasy, and consequently the era of the Antichrist, who will himself be a scourge of God.

**Translator:** A scourge.

**Professor Bezerra:** Exactly. Now, the doctrine of the seven Laws of Noah is crystallized in Maimonides, and then it begins to grow within Christendom, within the Christian sphere in Europe, through the Masonic lodges.

**Translator:** In Maimonides. In Christianity, through the Masonic Lodges during the [missing time frame, likely 18th-19th century].

**Professor Bezerra:** And regarding how the Catholic Church would incorporate the Laws of Noah, it was written by the Rabbi of Livorno, Elias Benamozegh. Elias Benamozegh, the Rabbi of Livorno, was the one who formalized the plan for the Catholic Church to adhere to the principles of Noah, of the Laws of Noah.

**Translator:** Rabbi Benamozegh. Elias Benamozegh.

**Professor Bezerra:** So, in the 19th century, two things happened. The first, Chabad-Lubavitch, catalyzing the Jewish people, catalyzing the Jewish people, so that the Laws of Noah would be disseminated to humanity. OK.

**Translator:** Jewish Laws.

**Professor Bezerra:** And Rabbi Benamozegh, seeking to purify the Catholic Church of its doctrine.

**Translator:** Rabbi Benamozegh, purify the Catholic Church.

**Professor Bezerra:** Regarding the divinity of Christ, the Most Holy... Regarding the divinity of Christ, the Most Holy Trinity, and the priesthood.

**Translator:** Divinity of Christ, Holy Trinity, and priesthood.

**Professor Bezerra:** And in this way, the Catholic Church would not need to be destroyed, but it would readapt for a new function. Which would be to promote universal fraternity and peace based on unity, on union between all religions.

**Translator:** Universal fraternity. All religions.

**Translator:** Jules Isaac says in his books in the 1940s and 1950s...

**Professor Bezerra:** of the Synagogue was to purify the Church, said Jules Isaac in his book.

**Translator:** Exactly.

**Translator:** Dr. Hogan, do you have a book by Julius Isaac?

**Dr. Hogan:** That book is from Isaac. Isaac. Yes. No, this one is just mentioning it a great deal. He talks about repeatedly the idea the church must be purified.

**Translator:** In his books.

**Dr. Hogan:** Isaac. And his books.

**Translator:** And talks a lot.

**Dr. Hogan:** I speculated, I don't want to finish this way. I speculated part of the idea of Noahide. These people are self-imposed messianic figures. At the end of time, our Lord and Savior divides the goats and the sheep, the wheat and the tares, and they're substituting themselves in deciding between who dies. In that definitive moment, they're substituting the role of our Lord and Jesus, uh, Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Is that, I think, part of what's going on with Noahide?

**Translator:** It's an inversion of Christ. Uh, the division. He says there is a division. And the book he presented talks many times about... cites Jules Isaac many times. It's the book by Léon de Poncins, "Judaism and the Vatican Council".

**Translator:** "Judaism and the Vatican". Yes.

**Dr. Hogan:** And the Vatican. Yes. Yes. Well, gentlemen, this has been absolutely fascinating. It's been a delight to have you both on the show. Uh, I've... it's... it's um, I would encourage my audience. The links will be in there. Um, as as we move into these times, I think Professor Bezerra has an absolutely unique insight onto what's going on with the current pontificate, with the direction of world affairs, with the development of technology. So, once again, look forward to interacting with...

**Translator:** He thanks very much, said it was a wonderful experience and that he hopes in the future to interact again with the Professor.

**Professor Bezerra:** And I thank you very much, Dr. Hogan. I admire your work very much, I follow your work. I am very grateful for the opportunity of this conversation, of our meeting, and I sincerely hope that it will be repeated many other times.

**Translator:** I would say thank you very much and sorry if I have had some technical problems here and English issues. I'm very sorry about that. I did my best.

**Dr. Hogan:** Fred, you did amazing. I... You're... Thank you so much.

**Translator:** It's very hard. It's very hard. I never thought it was going to be that hard, but it was fantastic. I learned like it's, it's very good to, to be talking to such special people. Thank you very much for letting me in.

**Dr. Hogan:** Yes. So thank you again. And their organization is the Center for Catholic Studies in São Paulo. And we are going to say so long.

**Translator:** M.
