Episcopal Consecration in the Catholic Church

# Comparison of Old and New Episcopal Consecration Rites

We are now in the 5th decade of the post-Vatican II revolution. Serious Catholics 
have had to study their faith most diligently in order to keep it. The study of the 
Holy Sacrifice of the Mass has played a crucial role in safeguarding the traditional 
faith. Likewise, it is extremely important that Catholics study the sacraments in 
detail, in order to see how the new rites of the sacraments are "cut out of the same 
cloth" as the novus ordo missae.

Since the sacrament of holy orders is the life source as it were for the sacramental 
life of grace, it certainly seems fitting to start with the study of this sacrament. 
Furthermore, with the issuance of Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio, Summorum 
Pontificum, it is all the more imperative to compare the old and new rites, to see 
what changes were made in the modern rite. Because the consecration of a bishop is 
the highest order of the priesthood, it seems logical to start one's investigation 
there.

This is a comparison between the Old and New Rites for consecrating a bishop. The 
purpose here is to note all the changes that have been made.

## Initial Changes

| Change | Old Rite | New Rite |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **1. Terminology** | "Consecration of a Bishop" | "Ordination of a Bishop" |
| **2. Assisting Clergy** | Three bishops: one principal consecrator, and two assistant bishops, who sit next to the bishop-elect. [A special dispensation had to be given to have priests assist the bishop-elect in lieu of bishops.] | There is the principal consecrator, assisted by at least two other consecrating bishops. The bishop-elect is assisted by two priests, not by any of the bishops. |
| **3. Mass Celebration** | The Mass is simultaneously celebrated by the Consecrator and the Bishop-elect, "betokening the unity of their faith." —According to the Roman Pontifical | "It is most appropriate for all the consecrating bishops and the priests assisting the bishop-elect to concelebrate the Mass with the principal consecrator and with the bishop-elect."—Introduction in the New Roman Pontifical |

## Ceremony Comparison

### Solemn Ascertaining vs. Presentation

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| **The Solemn Ascertaining that the Bishop-elect Has the Right to Episcopal Consecration** | **The Consent of the People** |
| The senior assisting bishop presents the Bishop-elect. There is the call for the Mandate or Apostolic Letter from the Pope. The Mandate or Apostolic Letter is read aloud. | After the mandate is read all present say: "Thanks be to God." or give their assent in some other way. [This is a very protestant sounding concept.] |

### Oath of Submission

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| **The Receiving of the Bishop-elect's Oath of Submission to the Holy See** | **[OMITTED]** |
| The Bishop-elect kneels before the Consecrator and reads the oath. This solemn oath states that the Bishop-elect will obey the Roman pontiff and his successors. "I..., elected to the Church of..., from this hour henceforward will be obedient to Blessed Peter the Apostle, and to the holy Roman Church, and to our Holy Father, Pope..., and to his successors canonically elected..." [Full oath continues] | This entire oath is omitted in the New Rite. |

### Mass Structure

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| **The Mass of the Catechumens** | **The Liturgy of the Word** |
| Once the examination is finished the Bishop-elect kisses the Consecrating Bishop's hand. It is important to note that the Mass begins after the examination as if to show that now the official ceremony may proceed because we have an acceptable candidate for the episcopacy. | Because this rite takes place in the Novus Ordo Missae, it is imperative to note that this rite takes place in a sacrilegious Mass. Therefore, the rite begins with the Novus Ordo's "Liturgy of the Word," which includes the reading of the Epistle and Gospel. |

### Presentation Details

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| This was done by the senior bishop in the Old Rite before the Mass began. | The bishop-elect is presented by one of the priest assistants. "Most Reverend Father, our holy Mother the Catholic Church, asks that you **promote this priest** here present to the **burden** of the episcopate." |
| Note the word usage "promote this priest" certainly implies the intention to bring him to a higher rank in the priesthood, namely, the fullness of the priesthood which is the episcopate. The term "burden" also indicates the larger responsibilities involved with being a bishop. | "Most Reverend Father, the church of N. asks you to **ordain this priest**, N., for service as bishop." Note the word usage "ordain this priest" could actually imply that this man has not been made a priest yet and as a priest he will serve as a bishop, as a mere title. |

### Examination Questions Comparison

| Question # | Old Rite | New Rite |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **1** | "We ask you, dearest brother, if you desire to make your conduct harmonize, as far as your nature allows, with the meaning of divine Scripture?" The Bishop-elect answers: "With my whole heart I wish in all things to consent and obey." | "My brother, are you resolved by the grace of the Holy Spirit to discharge to the end of your life the office the apostles entrusted to us, which we now pass on to you by the laying on of hands?" This is a troubling departure from the Old Rite because it doesn't specify exactly what office is to be given. |
| **2** | "Will you teach the people for whom you are ordained, both by words and by example, the things you understand from the divine Scriptures?" | "Are you resolved to be faithful and constant in proclaiming the Gospel of Christ?" This is vague and too general of a question. What does it mean to be faithful and constant in proclaiming the Gospel of Christ? |
| **3** | "Will you receive, keep and teach with reverence the traditions of the orthodox fathers and the decretal constitutions of the Holy and Apostolic See?" | "Are you resolved to maintain the deposit of faith, entire and incorrupt, as handed down by the apostles and professed by the Church everywhere and at all times?" However, taking a closer look and comparing it with the Old Rite, one can see many ambiguities. |
| **4** | This question doesn't really have a parallel one in the Old Rite. | "Are you resolved to build up the Church as the body of Christ and to remain united to it within the order of bishops under the authority of the successor of the apostle Peter?" What is exactly meant here "to build up the Church as the body of Christ"? |
| **5** | "Will you exhibit in all things fidelity, submission, obedience, according to canonical authority, to Blessed Peter the Apostle, to whom was given by God the power of binding and of loosing, and to his Vicar our Holy Father, Pope N. and to his successors the Roman Pontiffs?" | "Are you resolved to be faithful in your obedience to the successor of the apostle Peter?" |

### **CRITICAL OMISSIONS IN NEW RITE**

The following questions from the Old Rite are **COMPLETELY OMITTED** in the New Rite:

- Will you refrain in all your ways from evil and, as far as you are able, with the 
  help of the Lord, direct them to every good?
- Will you observe and teach with the help of God, chastity and sobriety?
- Will you, as far as your human frailty shall allow, always be given up to divine 
  affairs and abstain from worldly matters or sordid gains?

**Most importantly, all the specific questions regarding the doctrines of the faith 
have been omitted in the New Rite!**

### Faith Examination (OLD RITE ONLY)

The Old Rite contains a detailed examination on the faith, including:

- "Do you believe in the Holy Trinity...?"
- "Do you believe each single Person of the Holy Trinity is God, true, full, and 
  perfect?"
- "Do you believe in the Son of God...?"
- "Do you believe in the Holy Ghost...?"
- "Do you believe that this Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church is the one, true 
  Church, in which there is but one true baptism and the true remission of all sins?"
- "Do you also anathematize every heresy that shall arise against this Holy Catholic 
  Church?" — "I do anathematize it."

**These crucial faith questions are ENTIRELY ABSENT from the New Rite.**

## The Consecration Itself

### Understanding Sacramental Validity

Pope Pius XII declared ex cathedra that "the **matter** of the Sacred Orders of 
deaconate, priesthood, and the episcopate **is the imposition of hands**. The 
**form** is the **words determining the application of the matter**, by which the 
sacramental effects are univocally signified --- namely the **power of Orders** and 
the **grace of the Holy Spirit**."

The words of the form **must specify** what **power of orders** is given and **that 
the grace of the Holy Ghost** is given.

### Laying on of Hands

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| Then the Consecrator and the assistant bishops (all wearing mitres) touch with both hands the head of the one to be consecrated (who is still kneeling) saying: "Receive the Holy Ghost." | All rise. The bishop-elect kneels before the principal consecrator and the principal consecrator lays his hands upon the head of the bishop-elect **in silence**. After him, all the bishops present do the same. **NOTE: This action is done in silence!** |

### The Prayer of Consecration

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| **Essential Form (Pope Pius XII):** "Fill up (complete, perfect) in Thy Priest the perfection (sum total) of thy ministry and sanctify with the dew of Thy heavenly ointment this Thy Servant (the Bishop-elect) decked out (adorned, embellished) with the ornaments of all beauty (glory)." | **The Prayer is broken into three parts:** 1st part - principal consecrator alone 2nd part - all consecrating bishops together 3rd part - principal consecrator alone |

#### Analysis of New Rite Prayer Parts

**1st Part Issues:**
- Filled with ambiguity
- "by your gracious word" - what does this mean?
- "you chose the descendants of Abraham to be your holy nation" - who are these 
  descendants?

**2nd Part Issues:**
- Does not mention the power of orders
- Doesn't mention the priesthood at all!
- "governing Spirit" - unclear reference
- Nothing mentions or asks for the full power of the priesthood or the grace of the 
  Holy Ghost as Pope Pius XII declares as absolutely necessary
- The "chosen one" is not referred to as a priest

**3rd Part Issues:**
- Nothing specifically states the full power of the priesthood is given
- "high priest" is vague - doesn't mean "full" priesthood
- The term "high" is vague and certainly does not mean "full"
- Very ambiguous wording throughout

### Anointing Differences

| Old Rite | New Rite |
|----------|----------|
| **Anointing of Hands** | **[OMITTED]** |
| The hands are anointed in the form of a cross with specific prayers referring to the full powers of the Priesthood. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: "This unction indicates the powers that are given to him." | The anointing of the hands is completely omitted in the New Rite! By omitting this part, one could be led to think that there is an aversion to mentioning the specific powers of the episcopacy. |

### Investiture Differences

| Item | Old Rite | New Rite |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Ring** | Solemn blessing of the ring, then placed with prayer about "unspotted faith" and keeping the Church "inviolably" | The solemn blessing of the ring is omitted! Simple placement with modified prayer. |
| **Gloves** | Elaborate blessing and investiture with prayers about cleanness of heart and deed | **COMPLETELY OMITTED** |
| **Mitre** | Solemn blessing with prayer calling it "helmet of protection and salvation" | Placed **in silence** with no blessing |
| **Staff** | Blessed with prayer, then given with admonishment about justice tempered with meekness | Given last without blessing, with vague wording about pastoral office |

## Conclusion

The modern rite of consecration and the new mass are fruits of the post-Vatican II 
revolution. Our Lord advised us to make judgments when he said, "By their fruits you 
shall know them... Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil 
tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither 
can an evil tree bring forth good fruit." (St. Matthew 7:16, 18).

The above comparisons demonstrate:

1. **Doctrinal questions completely removed** - No examination of specific Catholic 
   beliefs
2. **Essential prayers modified or omitted** - Questions about sacramental validity
3. **Ceremonial elements diminished** - Less solemnity and precision
4. **Ambiguous language** - Unclear references to powers and duties
5. **Protestant-style elements** - Such as "consent of the people"

The reader can draw their own conclusions about these changes and this fruit of the 
revolution.
