Faithful to eternal Rome, guardians of Tradition

# Declaration of November 21, 1974

This declaration affirms fidelity to traditional Catholic Rome, while rejecting 
the neo-modernist and church-destroying reforms of the Second Vatican "Council".

## Declaration

We adhere with all our heart, with all our soul to Catholic Rome, guardian of 
the Catholic faith and of the traditions necessary for maintaining this faith, 
to eternal Rome, mistress of wisdom and truth.

We refuse, on the contrary, and have always refused to follow the Rome of 
neo-modernist and neo-Protestant tendency which manifested itself clearly in 
Vatican II Council and after the council in all the reforms that issued from it.

All these reforms, indeed, have contributed and still contribute to the demolition 
of the Church, to the ruin of the Priesthood, to the annihilation of the Sacrifice 
and the Sacraments, to the disappearance of religious life, to a naturalist and 
Teilhardian teaching in Universities, Seminaries, catechesis, teaching issued 
from liberalism and Protestantism condemned many times by the solemn magisterium 
of the Church.

No authority, even the highest in the hierarchy, can constrain us to abandon or 
diminish our Catholic faith clearly expressed and professed by the magisterium 
of the Church for nineteen centuries.

Is this not what the Holy Father repeats to us today? And if a certain contradiction 
should manifest itself in his words and acts as well as in the acts of the 
dicasteries, then we choose what has always been taught and we turn a deaf ear 
to the destructive novelties of the Church.

One cannot profoundly modify the "lex orandi" without modifying the "lex credendi". 
To the new mass corresponds new catechism, new priesthood, new seminaries, new 
universities, charismatic, Pentecostal Church, all things opposed to orthodoxy 
and to the magisterium of all time.

This Reform, issued from liberalism, from modernism, is entirely poisoned; it 
comes from heresy and leads to heresy, even if all its acts are not formally 
heretical. It is therefore impossible for any conscious and faithful Catholic 
to adopt this Reform and to submit to it in any way whatsoever.

The only attitude of fidelity to the Church and to Catholic doctrine, for our 
salvation, is the categorical refusal to accept the Reform.

This is why without any rebellion, any bitterness, any resentment we continue 
our work of priestly formation under the star of the magisterium of all time, 
persuaded that we cannot render a greater service to the Holy Catholic Church, 
to the Sovereign Pontiff and to future generations.

This is why we hold firmly to all that has been believed and practiced in faith, 
morals, worship, catechism teaching, priest formation, institution of the Church, 
by the Church of all time and codified in books published before the modernist 
influence of the council, waiting for the true light of Tradition to dispel 
the darkness that obscures the sky of eternal Rome.

In doing so, with God's grace, the help of the Virgin Mary, of Saint Joseph, 
of Saint Pius X, we are convinced of remaining faithful to the Catholic and 
Roman Church, to all the successors of Peter, and of being the "fideles 
dispensatores mysteriorum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Spiritu Sancto".
