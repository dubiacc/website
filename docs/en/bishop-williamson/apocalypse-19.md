Heavenly "Alleluias" celebrate God's judgment on Babylon, whose smoke is eternal.
God rewards good, punishes wicked — essential for salvation. True praise requires 
God's fear. The Lamb weds His elect Church; blessedness is eternal union with God, 
not worldliness. Christ, the Word, comes as divine warrior.

# Apocalypse 19 – Divine Justice and Victorious Christ

Bishop Williamson explains Revelation 19, beginning with the four "Alleluias" in
heaven celebrating God's just judgment on the "great prostitute" Babylon, whose smoke
of damnation rises eternally. He says this reflects the constant biblical theme of
God rewarding the good and punishing the wicked, an essential truth to hold for
salvation. 

Bishop Williamson emphasizes that true praise requires the fear of God,
contrasting it with superficial worship, and briefly discusses St. Thomas Aquinas'
view of the Beatific Vision as primarily an act of the intellect. 

He describes the wedding of the Lamb with His immaculate Church, composed of the elect, and highlights
that true blessedness belongs to those who live for eternal union with God, not to
the wealthy, learned, or powerful of this world. Bishop Williamson clarifies why the
angel refuses John's adoration, citing the elevation of human nature by the
Incarnation. 

Finally, he interprets the vision of Christ as the divine warrior on a
white horse, His name "Word of God," followed by the armies of heaven, wielding a
two-edged sword to judge the nations and rule with a rod of iron.

## The Heavenly Chorus: Alleluias and Judgment (Revelation 19:1-3)

Revelation Chapter 19, verse 1: "After these things I heard as it were a voice of
many multitudes in heaven saying: Alleluia. Salvation, and glory, and power is to
our God." Salvation comes from God alone, and so glory to Him alone. Alleluia.
There is a series of Alleluias in this chapter: verse 1, verse 3, verse 4, and
verse 6. Alleluia is untranslatable, perhaps akin to "Yippee" or "Good on you."

Verse 2: "For true and just are his judgments, who hath judged the great harlot,
which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath revenged the blood of
his servants, at her hands." In Latin, it is ambiguous: the prostitute corrupted
the land with her prostitution, and secondly, the Lord God avenged the blood of
His servants at her hands. So, God's judgment on the prostitute was doubly just:
she had corrupted the land and shed the blood of God's servants. The Lord God
revenged the blood of His servants.

Verse 3: "And again they said: Alleluia. And her smoke ascendeth for ever and
ever." The Alleluia goes on forever; in heaven, the saints will be crying Alleluia
for eternity. The Alleluia is eternal, and the smoke of Babylon's damnation also
rises eternally.

The Psalms constantly affirm good for the good and bad for the bad. It is an
expression of faith that there is a God in command of the universe who will punish
the wicked and reward the good. This is something that many things in this life
seem to contradict, but it is essential to keep hold of to get to heaven. During
this life, for the mass of people, what life is really about seems to be hidden.
Blessed are those few who see and then live in accordance, who live against the
grain of this whole life. This is what the Apocalypse is saying all the time: live
against the grain of this life, against everything that other men hold to be worth
living for and dying for. They trample the world beneath their feet purely to
obtain the joys of heaven. But you have to believe in heaven to get there because
there is so little apparent in this life that seems to support it. That is what
the Psalms are all about, and this is obviously what the Apocalypse is also all
about. Live for eternity, live for God, because after death, things shall not be
the same way as they seemed before death. So, in heaven, they will be crying
Alleluia while all earthly materialism, prosperity, success, and skyscrapers will
be going up in eternal smoke—an eternal monument to the stupidity of materialism
and the wrath of God.

## The Elders and Living Creatures Adore (Revelation 19:4)

Verse 4: "And the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures fell
down and adored God that sitteth upon the throne, saying: Amen; Alleluia."
The 24 elders are the 12 prophets of the Old Testament and the 12 Apostles of the
New Testament, and all evangelizers associated with them—all those who preach the
kingdom of God in the Old or New Testament or at any time. We first met the 24
elders in Chapter 4, with the sea of glass and the rainbow over the throne. The
four living creatures are, of course, the evangelists, and all with them. They
adored God sitting upon the throne, saying, "Amen, Alleluia."

Saint Augustine says, "The whole occupation of the blessed will be to cry out,
'Alleluia,' Amen." "Alleluia" expresses rejoicing in the truth seen. "Amen"
expresses joy in possessing the truth. "Alleluia," rejoicing in the truth seen—
that is the Beatific Vision, the *visio quae facit beatum*.

## The Beatific Vision and True Praise (Revelation 19:5)

Saint Thomas Aquinas says the Beatific Vision is primarily and essentially vision,
upon which automatically and absolutely follows the joy in the will. It is an act
in itself of the intellect, the Beatific Vision, because it is a vision. Others,
probably Franciscan theologians—whom the Church does not condemn—put the primacy
in the will: love, love, love. But when you put the vision first, you anchor the
love in the object; upon the vision of the object follows an anchored rejoicing in
the will. But if you put the will first, you can put all kinds of nonsense in
front of it. So, it is much safer in that respect to give primacy to the vision.

Verse 5: "And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God,
all ye his servants; and you that fear him, little and great." Only those who fear
God can praise Him. God rejects the praise of lips proceeding from a corrupt
heart. All those Protestants, modernists, and liberals who claim they believe in
God, love God, and praise God, but have no fear of God, no sense of the real God
in their hearts or minds—their supposed praise is liable to be just so much
illusion. How can anybody have any knowledge at all of the real God without
having at least a filial fear? And most of us begin with a servile fear. The idea,
"it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Hebrews 10:31),
is often forgotten today in favor of a misunderstood "love." Saint Paul himself,
who was caught up to heaven—whether in the body or out of the body, God knows (2
Corinthians 12:2-3)—still expressed the fear of God.

Saint Paul recounts his raptures in 2 Corinthians because the Corinthians had been
questioning his apostleship. The whole of 2 Corinthians is a defense of the
ministers of the New Testament, and then of Saint Paul in particular. But Saint
Paul's boasting finally comes to rest in his infirmities. He says, "If I must
glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity" (2 Corinthians
11:30), because Christ's power comes into play when there is deficiency on the
part of the apostle. When the apostle is completely self-sufficient, God hangs
back. So, although Saint Paul was rapt up to heaven and saw secrets unlawful to
utter, he still implies it is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the
living God. Nobody who has any real idea of God can say anything else. He is
terrifying. Of course, He is love, but both are true. Today, the fearfulness of
God is often forgotten, and love is completely misunderstood, as if He will just
forgive everything, no matter what we do wrong. That is absolute nonsense.

So, "all ye his servants; and you that fear him, little and great." "Little and
great" refers to the doctors and the simple souls, the little souls and the great
souls, so to speak. But of course, even the great ones had better be like children
if they want to enter the Kingdom of God.

## The Reign of God and the Wedding of Lamb (Revelation 19:6-8)

Verse 6: "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice
of many waters, and as the voice of great thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the
Lord our God the Almighty hath reigned." The praise of God is like waters to
purify those who praise; it is like great thunder to terrorize the devils. This is
the fourth Alleluia: "Because the Lord our God the Almighty hath reigned." As
Lord, He is Creator. As God, He is the supreme good. He is "our God" by the
Incarnation. And fourthly, He is Almighty to save us.

Saint Thomas Aquinas sometimes distinguishes between titles like *Deus*, which
belong to God absolutely, and *Dominus*, which belongs to Him relatively—relative
to those creatures over whom He is Lord. He would be *Deus* if He had never created
anyone, but He is *Dominus* only by having created, in relation to His creatures.
Omnipotence is an absolute title. Saint Thomas derives God's omnipotence from His
being Pure Act (Summa Theologiae, Prima Pars, Question 3, then Question 25). Pure
Act has total, absolute, and complete clout. Question 3 on the simplicity of God
is decisive for the whole treatise on God; practically all the rest flows from it,
and Question 3 flows from Question 2 on the existence of God. God is omnipotent;
it belongs to His very being.

Notice an interesting point in verse 6: "the Lord our God Almighty has reigned."
In Hebrew, it appears there are no tenses for verbs; you just have a verb. When
translating into languages like Latin or Greek, you must put the verb into a
future, past, or present tense. In Hebrew, it is timeless. This verse was written
in Greek, but it reflects a Hebrew way of speaking. "The Lord God has reigned"
would be just as true to say "He is reigning" and "He will reign." It is a
timeless statement. The Lord God is number one.

This is a cause for rejoicing. Looking around the world today, one might not
think the Lord God is number one; one could easily think He has been pushed to one
side. Blessed are those who keep believing that God is number one in this
situation today. If you let go, like the great mass of men will under the
Antichrist, or as they are letting go today, such people will at least have to
convert if they are to save their souls. It is extraordinary that so few men live
in light of what really matters, what is absolutely true. Most men live
completely regardless. With recent affairs in Washington, it looks as though evil
is triumphant. What does morality matter? The president can trample all over any
of the Ten Commandments and be glorified for it. Why stick with the old morality?
Decent people used to talk about the moral majority in America. Now, it looks
like an immoral majority, and good men are discouraged. It looks as though there
are no votes on the right, and people are corrupting because it is a question of
morals. It is very grave. But still, Jesus is going to win. People forget that.

Verse 7: "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him; for the marriage of
the Lamb is come, and his wife hath prepared herself." This is the wedding of the
Lamb with the Church immaculate, consisting of the elect souls. The bride, the
Church, is cleansed of all vices of the old Adam. She has prepared herself and is
decked out in God's gifts. Saint Augustine says all merits are God's gifts.

Verse 8: "And it was granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine
linen, glittering and white. For the fine linen is the justifications of saints."
Linen is an earth-colored plant, whitened by repeated washing—a perfect image for
the souls of the saints, all of whom have struggled to reach sanctity. The linen
represents the souls of the saints purified of sin by the ascetic struggle, by
repeated washing. As linen is whitened by repeated washing, the saints are saints
by repeatedly struggling for virtue against the old Adam.

## Blessed are Those Called to the Supper (Revelation 19:9)

Verse 9: "And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they that are called to the
marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me: These words of God are true."
The angel said to write it down: *verba volant, scripta manent* (spoken words fly
away, written words remain). It is solemn and deserves to be written down.
"Blessed are they that are called to the feast of the wedding of the Lamb."
Blessed are not the wealthy, nor the learned, nor the powerful, but those who so
live as to be eternally one with God. Blessed are the Catholics who live by their
faith; they are not generally the impressive ones of this world.

Saint Paul comments on this in 1 Corinthians 1:23-29: "We preach Christ
crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles
foolishness: But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
power of God, and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than
men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For see your vocation,
brethren, that there are not many wise men according to the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble: But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that
he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that
he may confound the strong. And the base things of the world, and the things that
are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring
to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his sight."
So, it is neither wealth, nor learning, nor power, nor rank.

We had the same in the Epistle of James. "Do not the rich oppress you by might?"
(James 2:6). "Do they not draw you before the judgment seats? Do they not
blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?" The rich are not much use, so
why look after them so much?

## The Angel and John: Adoration in the New Covenant (Revelation 19:9-10)

The angel said to John, "These words of God are true," underlining the point.
Verse 10: "And I fell down before his feet, to adore him. And he said to me: See
thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren, who have the
testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy."

In the Old Testament, angels might accept men's adoration of *dulia* (there is
*latria* to God alone, *hyperdulia* to the Mother of God, and *dulia* to the
saints). But not since the Incarnation, which so elevated human nature. Angels
cannot accept the adoration of man since the Incarnation because our Lord took
human nature, not angelic nature. So the angel does not accept John's adoration.
"Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." The spirit of
prophecy in John testifies that he is an adoptive son of God through Jesus.
Therefore, as an adoptive son of God, he should not be falling down at the feet
of angels. John is prophesying with the whole Book of the Apocalypse; the Spirit
of God is in him.

## Christ the King and Warrior (Revelation 19:11-16)

Now we move into a new section, the condemnation of the beast, the Antichrist.
Verse 11: "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat
upon him was called faithful and true, and with justice doth he judge and fight."
The white horse is the immaculate humanity of Christ, carrying its rider, the
Divine Word, for 33 years on Earth. He who sat upon him was called Faithful and
True: faithful to God and to men, truthful, unlike other men. Psalm 115:11 (Vulgate,
Psalm 116:11 in modern Bibles) says, "Every man is a liar." With justice, He
judges and fights.

Verse 12: "And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
diadems, and he had a name written, which no man knoweth but himself." The eyes of
Jesus, like fire, burn away the sin of a soul. They melt its ice, its coldness.
They light up its path. And they fire the soul with charity. The diadems are the
many victories of Jesus over the world and the devil. He has a name written which
nobody knows except Himself; the name of Jesus has a power which is fully known
to God alone. Saint Bernardine of Siena especially promoted devotion to the name
of Jesus.

Verse 13: "And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name
is called, THE WORD OF GOD." The garment is the human flesh of Christ, sprinkled
in His own blood. Yet still, this is God's own Word. Though sprinkled in blood,
appearing as a victim, He is the Word of God.

Verse 14: "And the armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses,
clothed in fine linen, white and clean." The armies are the martyrs actually in
heaven and the Christians by desire in heaven. The white horses represent
chastity. The linen represents justifications, as verse 8 told us. "White" means
freedom from all error in the faith for the intelligence. "Clean" (or pure) means
freedom from all concupiscence in morals for the will.

Verse 15: "And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two-edged sword; that with it
he may strike the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty." The
sword is the Word of God issuing from the Savior's mouth. It is two-edged: to
prune the good and to cut down the wicked. Our Lord talks about pruning the good
in John 15:1-2: "I am the true vine; and my Father is the husbandman. Every
branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that
beareth fruit, he will purge [prune] it, that it may bring forth more fruit."
This is why even the good receive what looks like rough treatment, but it is for
a completely different purpose.

Verse 16: "And he hath on his garment, and on his thigh written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
