Bishop Williamson interprets the Book of Revelation's prophecies on Babylon, 
critiquing modern liberalism and the secular pursuit of equality as a dangerous 
deviation from Christian truth.

# Apocalypse, Equality, and the Crisis of Modernity

His grace explains that the visions in the Apocalypse progressively 
concentrate on the end times, with Chapter 18 detailing the ruin of Babylon, 
interpreted as the empire of evil. He says this prophetic fall is mirrored in 
contemporary society, citing urban decay and racial tensions, for example in 
New York. +Williamson argues that liberalism and materialism, particularly 
as promoted by "the whites," have misled and "poisoned" Black communities, 
fostering a "law of rising disappointments" that culminates in destructive 
outbursts. He posits that this is due to a rejection of natural hierarchies 
and divinely ordained differences.

He elaborates with St. Thomas Aquinas, that God designed inequality among peoples and individuals, each with a specific role, for the harmonious functioning of 
creation; differences between races and sexes are part of 
this reality. He condemns the modern, Rousseauean drive for absolute equality as a 
distortion of a Christian concept—true equality existing only before God in 
Christ—now detached from its spiritual foundation. 

He asserts that this secularized ideal of equality inevitably clashes with 
reality, leading to societal disorder. Bishop Williamson shows that liberalism's 
promise of equality without Christ is a dangerous falsehood, stemming from the 
attempt to retain Christian-derived ideals while abandoning Christ Himself, 
which explains the potent, yet destructive, appeal of ideologies like 
Rousseau's. His Excellency concludes that genuine harmony and proper order can only 
be restored by recognizing these realities within the framework of the Catholic faith.

## Introduction: The Apocalypse's Focus on the End Times

We are now addressing Chapter 18 of the Apocalypse, which concerns the punishment of 
Babylon—the woman representing sensuality building an empire of evil. This chapter 
marks our entry into the sixth grand vision of the Apocalypse.

The visions are structured as follows:

1.  The seven letters.
2.  The seven seals.
3.  The seven trumpets.
4.  The assaults of hell: the dragon, the woman, the two beasts, and the justice of 
    the Lamb (Chapters 12-14).
5.  The seven cups or vials of divine anger, with Chapter 17 (the scarlet woman) 
    acting as an appendix.
6.  The sixth grand vision: final divine justice, encompassing the ruin of Babylon 
    (Chapter 18), the victory of Christ (Chapter 19), and the culmination in the 
    final judgment (Chapter 20).

There is a pattern: the letters to the seven churches were spread somewhat evenly 
over the ages of Church history. The seven seals began to concentrate towards the 
end; for instance, the sixth seal was the persecution of Antichrist. The seven 
trumpets also show this concentration: after the first four, the fifth jumps to 
heresies preceding Antichrist (the locusts of Chapter 9, the modernists), followed 
by the two witnesses. The vision of the dragon and the woman covers some early 
Church history, but the two beasts and the justice of the Lamb clearly concern the 
end. Each successive vision concentrates more towards the end of Church history, 
towards the greatest fight and persecution of all.

The fifth vision, the seven vials, details seven kinds of punishment. While the 
first few vials relate to early apostolic preaching, the later ones jump forward to 
the end of the world: Antichrist, the beast, hypocrites, and so on. At least half 
of this vision concerns the end. The final divine justice (Chapters 18-20) is 
almost entirely about the end: the ruin of Babylon, the victory of Christ, and the 
final consummation. This represents a zeroing in on the end of Church history. This 
is one broad pattern for reading the Apocalypse, pulling it together.

## Chapter 18: The Ruin of Babylon

The final divine justice begins with the ruin of Babylon in Chapter 18.
"After these things, I saw another angel coming down from Heaven, having great 
power, and the earth was illuminated by his glory. And he cried out in his strength 
saying, 'Babylon the Great has fallen, has fallen, and it has become the dwelling 
place of devils, and the sanctuary of every unclean spirit, and the wildlife park 
of every unclean and hateful bird. Because all the nations have drunk of the wine 
of the wrath of its fornication, and the kings of the earth have fornicated with 
it, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the strength of its 
delights.'"

This sixth vision depicts God's judgment at the end of the world. These three 
chapters can be seen as:
- Chapter 18: The condemnation of Babylon.
- Chapter 19: The condemnation of the Antichrist.
- Chapter 20: The condemnation of the devil.

The angel in Chapter 18, verse 1, is Christ, coming down from Heaven in the 
Incarnation, having great power, illuminating the earth with His glory—"Gloria in 
Excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis." He cried out, proclaiming 
in His strength. What Christ proclaims is the warning of the end of the world, as 
found in the Gospels. His preaching cannot be silenced. He proclaims, "Babylon the 
Great has fallen, has fallen." Babylon is the empire of evil, welcoming devils, a 
dwelling place of devils.

### Babylon in the Modern World: Societal Decay

Consider New York today, or London, or Paris—it is much the same. A recent 
newsletter quoted people in the streets of New York as being ready to tear one 
another to pieces. This referred to Blacks in New York. I know a Jewish convert, 
now in her sixties, whose husband has since died. She still calls me. She lives in 
New York and witnesses the daily situation. She told me recently, "It's for soon," 
referring to impending chaos. She encounters Black individuals who are deeply 
discontented, rebellious. She and her late husband recounted being told by some, 
"Nothing against you personally, but we're going to kill all of you," or words to 
that effect. It is small consolation that such threats are not personal.

This sounds entirely likely. While one cannot say it is all the fault of the 
whites—that would be stupid, as it is also the fault of the Blacks—if the Blacks 
had been properly led, not misled into the dead end of materialism by the whites, 
they would not be in this state. They were not like that on the plantations in the 
South. Liberals thought they knew better and destroyed the South. Many Blacks then 
streamed north, sold on the idea of how wonderful, enlightened, and superior the 
North was. What were they given? Essentially, money. When a quarter of Los Angeles 
was destroyed, the government rebuilt it, keeping them quiet with money.

Whites often do not genuinely like or respect Blacks. There is a great pretense of 
union, but it is not real because there is no true charity or love of God in it. It 
is based on a humanistic sense of liberal superiority and equality. Blacks were 
given liberty and equality but did not know what to do with it, often ending up 
filling prisons. Building more prisons seems to be the whites' primary solution. It 
is the liberals among the whites who have absolutely poisoned the Blacks.

This leads to what might be called the law of rising disappointed expectations. When 
people are disappointed with materialism, they are given more material goods. This 
merely postpones the problem, like a drug requiring increasing doses. Eventually, 
there are no more material goodies to distribute, and the law of rising 
disappointments leads to a major explosion. Some, like those in Los Angeles, do 
not care what they destroy, even their own facilities. A short circuit occurs, and 
the whole thing blows up. This is how they are, but not how they have to be. The 
Catholic Church in Africa, as Archbishop Lefebvre noted, has done wonders. The 
Church works with them effectively, provided the whites fulfill their own duties. 
If you call this racialism, so be it, just as distinguishing between men and women 
might be called sexism. It is reality.

## The Catholic Understanding of Order and Inequality

In the late '70s and early '80s, during visits to South Africa, I found that 
Catholic missionaries and priests—those with faith, working for the Church, not 
leftist priests—provided the most accurate picture of the situation. They 
understood that races are different, just as sexes are different.

St. Thomas Aquinas, in the Summa, outlines a method:
1.  *An sit*: Does it exist? The question of existence.
2.  *Quid sit*: What is it? Its essence, nature.
3.  *Quot sit*: Its parts, divisions, species.
4.  *Ordo partium*: The order of parts, their hierarchy.

This pattern underlies St. Thomas's analysis. He examines how a thing divides and 
the order of its parts—a leading part and subsequent parts. Applying this to 
humanity: humans exist; a human is a rational animal. What are the different kinds, 
the different races? It is obvious that races exist and have different 
characteristics. Different nations within a race have different characters; 
different regions within a nation vary. The south of France differs from the 
north, as does the south of England from the north. Even individual parishes or 
missions have distinct atmospheres, much like the churches to whom St. Paul wrote 
his Epistles. Each letter reflects the specific character of its recipients.

God's creation is full of differences, and these differences imply inequalities. In 
the Summa Theologiae (Prima Pars, Question 47, likely in *De Deo Creatore*), 
St. Thomas addresses inequality. Origen suggested inequality arose as a punishment 
for sin, stemming from our instinct that justice requires equality. If creation is 
unequal, God must be unjust. St. Thomas refutes this, explaining that God designs 
inequality because each part of His creation has a different role to play. Every 
part, as it comes from God, is well-designed for its purpose.

A humanity of all chiefs and no Indians would not work, nor one of all Indians and 
no chiefs. God distributes His gifts to ensure the right number of each. If men 
disrupt this order, pretending everyone is a chief, they create immense problems by 
deviating from reality. This is the error of Rousseau—the imposition of equality on 
everything. Pope Leo XIII affirmed that one cannot forcibly equalize the realities 
of life, where inequality is evident in all directions. The goal is not to level 
inequality but for everyone to do what God gifted them to do. Those with special 
talents have a responsibility to use them for leadership and service, not to waste 
them or pretend equality by behaving like the lowest. To do so is to go against 
God's plan and incur judgment.

## True Equality in Christ vs. Worldly Illusions

Races are different. If each does what it can do best, harmonized by the Catholic 
Church, there will be harmony. The Church is not a respecter of persons in the 
worldly sense. The Epistle of James (Chapter 2, verse 1 onwards) warns against 
showing partiality in church based on worldly appearances: "My brethren, have not 
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons." If a richly 
dressed man and a poorly dressed man enter, do not favor the rich man. To do so is 
to judge by worldly standards. God has chosen the poor in this world to be rich in 
faith. The rich often oppress the Church, yet they are honored. True love of 
neighbor means treating all as Catholics before God.

Regarding the American South, while not idealizing it (slavery is a dangerous 
institution given human nature, though not necessarily a mortal sin), there was 
arguably more genuine knowledge and appreciation of Black individuals there than in 
the liberal North. Liberty is not the ultimate good; if it were, slavery would be 
the ultimate evil, as liberalism posits. However, slavery, while dangerous, is a 
system that can be operated.

As Catholics, we are all souls who will stand before God's judgment seat. There, we 
will be judged with absolute equality according to our talents, gifts, and 
positions—those in higher positions more severely. This is the only true sense in 
which we are absolutely equal. This deep, instinctive realization of fundamental 
human equality is what reacts against perceived injustices. Origen misinterpreted 
this, suggesting inequality was a punishment. St. Thomas corrected this: inequality 
is part of God's plan. For an untalented person to pretend to be talented, or a 
talented person to shirk their role by pretending to be untalented (e.g., whites 
denying any special role or responsibility), is equally against God's plan.

### Destructive Power of Rousseau and Secularized Equality

The modern world has it completely wrong. Liberalism is powerful. Why does Rousseau 
have such magnetic power to defy reality? Why does communism, another defiance of 
reality, gain traction with ideas like abolishing private property for universal 
benefit? Where does such nonsense get its power?

The answer lies in a debased Christianity. Before Christ, the equality James speaks 
of would have been absurd to a Roman senator. The Catholic Church gave humanity the 
idea that all are equal before God, redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. This 
deep sense of belonging to one family in Christ is expressed by St. Paul in 
Galatians 3:27-28: "For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on 
Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is 
neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus." St. Paul is not 
abolishing natural differences but revealing a profound spiritual equality in 
Christ previously unimagined.

Consider three stages:

1.  Ugly reality due to original sin, with little meaningful equality.
2.  That same reality, lifted by Christ into a new dimension where spiritual 
    equality exists alongside natural diversity.
3.  Christ is removed. The idea of equality, derived from Christian influence, 
    remains but is now detached from its source. This secularized equality then 
    clashes violently with unredeemed reality because Christ, who alone could 
    harmonize them, is gone.

The problem is the loss of faith. Rousseau's power comes from Christian ideas of 
Christendom, perverted by the pretense that Christendom can work without Christ. 
This idea—having the benefits of Christ (like equality) alongside the advantages of 
the devil and original sin—is immensely attractive. It is the promise of "having 
it both ways." Anyone offering to combine Christ and the devil will have a popular 
product, but it is utterly false. The power of Rousseau, and thus of liberalism, 
comes from pretending that the fruits of Christ can be had without Christ.

This is why the liberal North's pretense that treating Blacks with worldly equality 
will make everything wonderful is Rousseauean. It assumes an equality that only 
makes sense when lifted by Christ. Take Christ out, and this imposed equality 
collides with reality, leading to chaos. The same applies to issues like capital 
punishment.
