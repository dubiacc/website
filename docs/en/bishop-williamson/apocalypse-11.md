An exposition of the prophecy concerning the two witnesses who will appear during the
reign of the Antichrist, their powers, martyrdom, and resurrection.

# Apocalypse 11: The Two Witnesses

Bishop Williamson explains that Revelation Chapter 11 details the time of the
Antichrist, with false Christians joining the enemy. He says God will send two
witnesses, traditionally Elias and Enoch, to prophesy in sackcloth for 1,260 days.

Elias will restore all things, and Enoch will bring repentance to the nations.
Bishop Williamson describes them as olive trees and candlesticks, divinely protected
and powerful. He notes they will be killed by the Antichrist, their bodies publicly
displayed, but will then be resurrected and ascend to heaven, causing great fear. He
interprets the subsequent earthquake and destruction as symbolizing damnation and
emphasizes the need for the fear of God.

## The Time of the Antichrist and the Trampling of the Holy City (Revelation 11:1-2)

(Transcript starts): Chapter 11. "And it was given me a reed like unto a rod and it was
said to me, 'Arise, measure the temple of God and the altar and them that adore
therein. But the court which is without the temple cast out and measure it not
because it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city they shall tread under foot
two and 40 months.'" This is the time of the Antichrist himself.

Verse 2: "The court, the outer court, is the hardened sinners and heretics outside
the church. Throw them out is excommunicate them. Pay no attention to their false
pleading." "Do not measure it." "But the court which is without the temple, cast out
and measure it not." Measure it not; pay no attention to their false pleading.
"Because it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city, they shall tread under foot
two and 40 months."

False Christians will join the enemy in the time of trial. They hand it over to the
gentiles, the pagans. These people who are supposedly inside the temple, the outer
courtyard, which is part of the temple, is handed over to the gentiles. That is to
say that the false Christians are part of the enemy in the time of trial. "And they
will trample upon the holy city for 42 months." They will trample on the church for
the duration of the reign of the Antichrist. The Antichrist is going to reign three
and a half years, which is 42 months. They will trample upon the city for 42 months,
the reign of the Antichrist. The false Christians and the heretics will join forces
to trample upon the holy church.

## God's Two Witnesses (Revelation 11:3)

Verse 3: "And I will give unto my two witnesses." The holy city has been given to
the gentiles to trample upon, but it's also been given to God's two witnesses.
God will give the church also to His two witnesses, or He will give two witnesses
to His church. In this tremendous time of trial under the Antichrist, God will give
two witnesses to His church, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days. That's the
same period of time as 42 months. They will prophesy for the reign of the Antichrist
clothed in penance, clothed in sackcloth. "They shall prophesy a thousand two
hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth."

### Identity of the Two Witnesses: Elias and Enoch

God will give to His church, in this unparalleled trial, two witnesses. Tradition
takes this literally. Catholic tradition says one of them will be Elias (Malachi
Chapter 4, Verse 5). In Protestant terms, Elijah. You remember they asked our Lord
if he was Elias. Malachi Chapter 4, Verse 5: "Behold I will send you Elias the
prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." That's very
clear. Matthew Chapter 17, Verse 10; Mark Chapter 9, Verse 10; Luke Chapter 1,
Verse 17, all concern the return of Elias.

So tradition says that one of these two witnesses will be Elias, who is presently
in a quasi-Eden, a quasi-paradise garden. The original paradise garden was shut;
men were excluded from it with Adam. The children of men stood at the gates with a
flaming sword. But this is like a paradise garden, says Saint Gregory. Matthew
Chapter 17, Verse 11: "Jesus answering said to them, 'Elias indeed shall come and
restore all things.'" So Malachi 4:5 and Matthew 17:11, and the other quotations
concerning the return of Elias. I remember Archbishop Lefebvre saying at one stage,
"When is Elias coming?" He was anxious for Elias to put in an appearance because,
he said, "When are all things going to be restored?" Because, of course, all the
way up until the Archbishop died, they were still disintegrating, and some people
think that they've been disintegrating ever since, too, since 1991. So the
Archbishop was impatient for Elias to appear and restore all things. Notice that
expression by the Lord, "Elias indeed shall come and restore all things." It's an
interesting prophecy, our Lord himself speaking.

Tradition says that one of these two witnesses is Elias, because of course he didn't
die when he departed from Elisha in a chariot of fire, as Elisha saw him
disappearing. Nobody ever saw Elias die.

Secondly, Enoch. Genesis Chapter 5, Verse 22. The other witness is a Gentile. So
you've got a Jew and a Gentile to preach in this terrible trial to the Jews and the
Gentiles. Genesis Chapter 5, Verse 22: "And Enoch walked with God... Enoch lived 65
years and begot Methuselah and Enoch walked with God and lived after he begot
Methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were
365 years. And he walked with God and was seen no more because God took him." He
walked and was seen no more because God took him. It's suggestive of not
necessarily being death.

Ecclesiasticus Chapter 44, Verse 16: "Enoch pleased God and was translated into
paradise that he may give repentance to the nations." That's fairly clear. He
pleased God, he was "translated into paradise," meaning transferred. *Transfero*,
*transferre*, *transtuli*, *translatum*. Translated, translation, or transference.
Transfer or translation, same Latin word. "He was translated into paradise that he
may give repentance to the nations." That suggests exactly this. Elias will restore
all things. Enoch will give repentance to the nations. The two of them will be the
source of a great renewal in the church, or a great counterattack of the church,
the last gasp of the church under the Antichrist. It won't be the very last gasp
because the church will still be there at the very end of the world, but under the
Antichrist, in an unparalleled distress, the church will have unparalleled support
from these two great figures of its ancient past. Genesis 5:22 and Ecclesiasticus
44:16, referring to Enoch.

## Symbolism of the Two Witnesses (Revelation 11:4)

Verse 4: "These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand before
the Lord of the Earth." Olive trees, full of the unction of the Holy Ghost, full of
the oil of charity. Olive oil is a very rich oil; you can burn it in lamps or eat
it with food. "And two candlesticks," candlesticks holding up the truth of God to
enlighten men. He says they're not candles, but candlesticks. They hold up the
light; they aren't the light, but they hold up the light of God, like bishops are
meant to. We've seen bishops with candlesticks in Chapter 1. So here it's not
necessarily two bishops, but it's the two witnesses: olives full of unction, full
of charity, holding up the light of God. "Standing in the sight of the Lord of the
Earth," meaning they heed God's will and pay no attention to men, to worldly
pressures. They pay attention to the will of God.

## Divine Protection and Powers of the Witnesses (Revelation 11:5-6)

Verse 5: "And if any man will hurt them, fire shall come out of their mouths and
shall devour their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, in this manner must he
be slain." In English, it's the same word, "hurt." In Latin, it's two different
words: *nocēre* and *nŏcere*. For purposes of pronunciation, let me point out to
you: second conjugation, *nocēre*, *nocuisse*, *nocitum*. Third conjugation,
*nŏcere*. The 'e' in *nocēre* is long, and in *nŏcere* it is short. So, *nocēre*,
*nŏcere*. That's a mistake often made in reading Latin. Second conjugation, the
infinitive is long and accented: *nocēre*. Third conjugation, the infinitive is
short, *nŏcere*, and the accent is off the infinitive. So, *nocēre* is second
conjugation, and *nŏcere* is third conjugation.

The difference is: anyone who harms them (*nŏcere*) will be confounded by the fire
of their charity, and anyone who physically hurts them (*nocēre*) will be condemned
to death. So, anyone who harms them will be confounded by the fire of their charity.
If anyone hits them, punches them, slugs them, he will die the death. Anyone
physically hurting them will be condemned to death. So the two witnesses are going
to enjoy the protection of God.

Verse 6: "These have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their
prophecy, and they have power over waters to turn them into blood and to strike the
earth with all plagues as often as they will."
The two olive branches, the two candlesticks, evoke Zachary Chapter 4, the vision
of the golden candlesticks. "And the angel that spoke... came again, he waked me as a
man that is waken out of his sleep and he said to me, 'What seest thou?' And I said,
'I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold and its lamp upon the top of it,
and there's seven lights... and seven funnels for the lights... And two olive trees
over it, one upon the right side of the lamp and the other upon the left side.' ...
And the angel said... 'This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel. Not with an army
nor by might but by my spirit,' saith the Lord of Hosts." And I asked, "What were
the two olive trees...?" Verse 14, he said, "These are two sons of oil who stand
before the Lord of the whole earth." These are two great figures of the restoration:
Jesus the high priest (not Jesus the Messiah) and Zerubbabel the prince. It's
church and state, the two anointed ones of the Lord, for the salvation of Israel.
So there's an evocation in Zachary Chapter 4; the two witnesses are a little like
the two olive trees in Zachary.

These will have the power of shutting heaven, lest it rain for the days of their
prophecy, and they have the power over the waters of turning them into blood, and
of shaking the earth with every torment. "And strike the earth with all plagues as
often as they will."

Either literally, Elias and Enoch will control the rain and plagues. Compare
3 Kings Chapter 17, Verse 1 (Elias stopping the rain) and Exodus Chapter 7 onwards
(Moses bringing plagues upon the Egyptians). James in his epistle speaks of Elias'
power of prayer. James Chapter 5, Verse 17: "Elias was a man passible like unto us.
And with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not
for three years and six months." The reference is to 3 Kings 17:1. So you have
3 Kings 17:1 and James 5:17 both referring to Elias' power to prevent rain.

There's a story about the Grasshopper Chapel in Minnesota. There was a plague of
grasshoppers in the 19th century, and Catholics began praying. They may have
promised to build a chapel if the grasshoppers stopped. The grasshoppers stopped,
so they built a chapel. It's strange how these little creatures can get out of
control, multiplying by the million and eating everything. When they die on roads,
they make such a slush it's like pouring oil, very dangerous.

So, either they're going to cause plagues literally, or figuratively they will shut
the mouths of heretics and demonstrate the heretics' teaching to be bloody. The
teaching of heretics ends up in blood. Luther is the classic example. Luther revolts
in 1517. In 1525, you have the Peasants' Revolt, which the princes put down in blood.
Figuratively, they will impress on men the plagues of God's chastisements.

## Martyrdom of the Witnesses (Revelation 11:7)

Verse 7: "And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out
of the abyss shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them."
The beast is the Antichrist, coming out of the abyss in his true colors. He will
make war upon them and conquer them and kill them. The Antichrist, infuriated by
the two witnesses' resistance, will overwhelm them and kill them.

## Desecration of Their Bodies and Rejoicing of the Wicked (Revelation 11:8-10)

Verse 8: "And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which is
called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified." Their
bodies shall lie in the streets of Jerusalem. The great city is obviously Jerusalem.
Their bodies will be paraded all over the streets of Jerusalem, which at that point
by its dumbness and blindness will be like Sodom, and by its idolatry will be like
Egypt. So Jerusalem is going to be again in bad shape. Despite the witnesses coming
to the help of the church, Jerusalem will be exulting in the Antichrist. Jerusalem
will be as dumb and blind, spiritually, as Sodom, and as idolatrous as Egypt;
Jerusalem, where also their Lord was crucified.

Verse 9: "And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall see
their bodies for three days and a half, and they shall not suffer their bodies to
be laid in sepulchers." In other words, the Antichrist has a kind of universal
reign, like Christ had. Three and a half days, the Church commentators say, may be
longer for everybody to be able to see. Three and a half days may again be a
non-literal figure: a day, and two days, and half a day. It may be longer than 84
hours for all people to enjoy the sight of the two great witnesses of God struck
down. They will not allow their bodies to be buried, wanting to exult over their
defeat. Once again, it's going to look pretty bad for the church. Catholics are
going to be in a rough way at that point in time.

Verse 10: "And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry
and shall send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented them that
dwelt upon the earth." So the wicked people under the Antichrist are happy to have
got rid of the two witnesses. Obviously, the two witnesses have given Catholics
very necessary and much-needed support in those terrible moments. But the people are
exulting in the destruction of the two witnesses.

Those inhabiting the earth, the earthly men, materialistic men who have no thought
of Heaven, rejoice. As St. Paul says (Colossians Chapter 3, Verse 1-2): *Quae sursum
sunt sapite, non quae super terram.* "Savor the things of Heaven, not the things
of earth." These are the people who are savoring the things of earth, whom we would
call today materialists. They are delighted that the two witnesses are dead, who
kept talking of the things of Heaven.

Some people want to say that Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop de Castro Mayer were
the two witnesses. That's a classic example. Maybe the pattern fits, yes. But it's
certainly not limited to those two. Obviously not. Even if you might fit the two
bishops under this heading, the pattern is obviously much wider. Everything indicates
it's a literal prophecy for the times of the Antichrist. That's certainly how Church
commentators and Catholic tradition take it, and there are other verses of scripture.

## Resurrection and Ascension of the Witnesses (Revelation 11:11-12)

Verse 11: "And after three and a half days, the spirit of life from God entered
into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon those who saw
them." The two witnesses are resurrected. Notice it says, "the spirit of life from
God entered into them." Past tense. Verse 10 was in the future tense: "they that
dwell shall rejoice and make merry, shall send gifts." Verse 11 switches to the
past tense. This is the divine point of view, from which all time is present to God.
Past and future are simultaneous in front of God. What is past and future to us is
simultaneous before God. He could have said, "The spirit of God will enter into them,
they will stand up on their feet." But from God's point of view, that future is
like the past.

"The spirit of God entered into them, they stood up on their feet, and a great
fear." People are frightened rigid, scared stiff that the two witnesses told the
truth. The fact that they are resurrected makes all of those who persecuted and
killed them afraid that the two witnesses were telling the truth. They're absolutely
scared of the hell that the two witnesses said was awaiting them. It must be a bit
frustrating to take all the trouble to put somebody to death and then they come to
life again.

Verse 12: "And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, 'Arise hither.'
And they arose to heaven on a cloud and their enemies saw them." Their mission is
fulfilled; they go to heaven. We're still not at the end of the world.

## The Great Earthquake and Its Aftermath (Revelation 11:13)

Verse 13: "And at that hour, there was made a great earthquake, and the tenth part
of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake names of men seven thousand,
and the rest were cast into a fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven." The
earthquake of Verse 13 is literal.

"And the tenth part of the city fell." Souls in heaven fill nine ranks, left empty
by the fallen angels. Into none of those nine ranks enters the tenth part of the
city, who are then the souls damned. The nine ranks of angels are: Seraphim,
Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, Archangels, and
Angels. You find these listed, for example, in St. Paul's epistles (Ephesians
Chapter 1, Verse 21 and Colossians Chapter 1, Verse 16). Seraphim and Cherubim are
in many places in the Old Testament; Angels and Archangels are everywhere. The
others are found in these lists in St. Paul. So, nine ranks are being filled by the
souls of the saved. The tenth part is those who don't make it into any of the nine
ranks – in other words, the souls of the damned. Of these damned souls, 7,000
representatives, servants of the Antichrist, perish here in this earthquake, a
little comparable to the earthquake after the death of our Lord. Many servants of
the Antichrist die on the spot.

"And the rest were cast into a fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven." Those who
weren't killed by the earthquake at least momentarily converted. They were filled
with the fear of God.

## The Need for the Fear of God

What's very much missing today is the fear of God. I think all of us could do with a
good dose of it because the power of God is very much forgotten today. People are
filled with the idea of the power of men: tremendous machines, explosives, atom
bombs, and so on. But that's absolute peanuts compared with the power of God. People
have no concept of the frightening power of God.

Where do you go in Scripture to see the power of God frightening men out of their
wits? Exodus. Turn to Exodus. "Oh, Moses, keep him away!" They're shaking in their
shoes. It's the thunder and lightning. Exodus Chapter 19, Verses 16-18: "And all
Mount Sinai was on a smoke because the Lord was come down upon it in fire and the
smoke arose from it as out of a furnace and all the mount was terrible. And the
sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder..." Moses spoke and God
answered him.

Then, Chapter 20, Verse 19 (actually verses 18-19): "And all the people saw the
voices, and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking, and
being terrified and struck with fear, they stood afar off saying to Moses, 'Speak
thou to us and we will hear. Let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die.'" "And Moses
said to the people, 'Fear not, for God has come to prove you...'" "And the people
stood afar off." They're scared. Any of us would have been when the Lord God has
been shaking mountains.

The world today needs that. Oh, man, does it need it. But in His infinite wisdom,
God is abstaining from manifestations of His power. But He's going to show His
power again, sometime, somehow, someway. I don't know how it might work, but it's
going to be frightening when He does.
