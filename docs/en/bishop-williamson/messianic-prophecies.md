Transcript of the talk by Bishop Williamson: Messianic Prophecies

# Messianic Prophecies

Bishop Williamson guides listeners through key Old Testament Messianic prophecies,
explaining how they reveal the coming Savior. He says early prophecies show the
Messiah will descend from Adam by a woman, conquer Satan, be a Semite, and a
descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, specifically from the tribe of Judah,
holding a scepter and being the expectation of nations. 

He explains Balaam's prophecy of a Star and Scepter from Jacob/Israel 
points to a king who enlightens and defeats God's enemies. Bishop Williamson 
clarifies Moses' prophecy of a prophet like himself refers to the Messiah as the 
supreme prophet, liberator, mediator, and legislator, surpassing Moses. 

Moving to Davidic times, he highlights Anna's canticle foretelling a king and 
Christ, and Nathan's prophecy to David promising a descendant whose kingdom God 
will establish forever, showing a double fulfillment in Solomon and Christ. 

Finally, he surveys the prophets, stating Joel foretold the Messiah coming for all men of all conditions with great prodigies; Micah prophesied his birth of a woman in Bethlehem and peaceful reign; and Isaiah
described the Church as a mountain all nations flock to, recognizing God, and a
holy city purified, protected by God's power, along with the famous prophecy of
a virgin conceiving Emmanuel, and the Messiah illuminating Galilee.

## Introduction and Early Prophecies

We're going to look at some Messianic prophecies today. One, early times.
Two, Davidic times. Three, prophets. Genesis 3:14-15. That's the famous
prophecy of the serpent and Eve. "The Lord God said to the serpent,
'Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle and
beasts of the earth. Upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou
eat all the days of thy life. I will put enmities between thee and the
woman and thy seed and her seed. She shall crush thy head, and thou shalt
lie and wait for her heel.'" The seed of the woman, Eve, refers to Jesus
Christ. Jesus Christ is going to crush Satan. Or she shall crush thy head.
The seed of Eve is going to crush the head of Satan. "And thou shalt lie and
wait for her heel." So the restorer of the salvation of men will descend
from Adam by a woman and will conquer Satan.

Genesis 9:26-27. This is the three sons of Noah. Noah tastes of the fruit of
the grape without anybody having warned him that it would be alcoholic.
For lack of a modern, wise government warning him against the dangers of
alcohol with every beverage that he would take, he fell down and uncovered
his nakedness. And two of his sons covered him up, and the third son made
fun of him. "And Noah, when he awakened from the wine, when he had learned
what his youngest son had done to him, he said, 'Cursed be Canaan! A servant
of servants shall he be unto his brethren.'" That's highly racist and highly
politically incorrect, but there it is in scripture. "And he said, 'Blessed
be the Lord God of Sem! Be Canaan his servant.'" Blessed be the Lord God of
Sem is the next prophecy: the Messiah is going to be of the race of Sem.
He is, in other words, going to be a Semite, which is highly politically
correct. The Messiah is going to be a Semite. Genesis 9:26. "May God enlarge
Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem." That's all of the Gentiles
who are going to live in the church set up by the Semite. The Japhetites,
that's you and me, most of us, are going to live in the tents of Sem,
in the Catholic Church, which was originally Jewish. The Gentiles are
going to dwell in and profit by the church of the Semite, which is the
Church of Jesus Christ. "And Canaan be his servant." So Canaan is going to
be the slave of Japheth and Sem. Sem is going to be the ancestor of the
Messiah, and Japheth will enlarge his, will be enlarged. Japheth will
dominate the world till he apostatizes.

Genesis 12:3. "And the Lord said to Abraham, 'Go forth out of thy country
and from thy kindred and out of thy father's house and come into the land
which I shall show thee. And I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless
thee and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed.'" Verse 3. "And I will
bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee. And in thee shall
all the kindred of the earth be blessed." Genesis 12:3. The Messiah is going
to be a descendant of Abraham. Also, Genesis 18:18, Genesis 22:18. Same thing.
The Messiah will be a descendant of Abraham, that's a promise of God.

Genesis 26:4, verse 1. "And when a famine came in the land, after that
barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to
Abimelech, king of the Palestines, to Gerar. And the Lord appeared to him,"
to Isaac, "'And said, 'Go now down to Egypt, but stay in the land that I
shall tell thee, and sojourn in it, and I will be with thee and will bless
thee. For to thee and to thy seed, I will give all of those countries to
fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.''" Verse 4, "'And I
will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven, and I will give to thy
posterity all these countries, and in thy seed shall all the nations of
the earth be blessed.'" Genesis 26:4. The Messiah will be a descendant of
Isaac. Abraham had various children. Amongst those children, it's Isaac who
will be the ancestor of the Messiah.

Genesis 28:14, verse 12. "Jacob saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the
earth, and the top thereof touching heaven, the angels also of God ascending
and descending by it, and the Lord leaning upon the ladder, saying to him,
'I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac. The land
wherein thou sleepest I will give to thee and to thy seed.'" Verse 14,
"'And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth. Thou shalt spread abroad
to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And in thee
and thy seed, all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.'" Genesis 28:14.
The Messiah will be a descendant of Jacob. Isaac had various sons, or at
least two, Esau and Jacob, and the Messiah will be a child of Jacob, not a
child of Esau. That's further precision.

Genesis 49, Jacob's prophecy concerning Judah. Genesis 49:1-10, 8-9-10.
Jacob, before he dies, blessing all his sons and saying what their various
fates will be, giving, prophesying for each of them. He prophesies concerning
Judah, which will be the favorite tribe, or the privileged tribe. Amongst
the 12 tribes, Judah will be privileged. "And Jacob called his sons and
said to them, 'Gather yourselves together that I may tell you the things
that shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together and
hear, O ye sons of Jacob. Harken to Israel, your father.'" Israel equals
Jacob. Verse eight, Judah, "'Thee shall thy brethren praise. Thy hands shall
be on the necks of thy enemies. The sons of thy father shall bow down to
thee.'" Verse nine, "'Judah is a lion's whelp. To the prey, my son, thou art
gone up. Resting, thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness who shall
rouse him?'" Ten, "'The scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, nor a
ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he shall be the
expectation of nations.'" That's a very clear Messianic prophecy, verse 10
especially. The Messiah will be of the tribe of Judah. He will hold a
scepter. "Thee shall thy brethren praise. Thy hands shall be on the necks of
thy enemies. The sons of thy father shall bow down to thee." All nations will
render him homage. All nations will render to Judah homage. It's obviously
not Judah himself because that never happened to Judah, but it will happen
to his descendant. It's the Messiah. All nations will render him homage.
And so he will be a pacifier, he will be a king of peace or a lord of peace.
Judah will lose its supremacy around the time he comes. "The scepter shall
not be taken away from Judah, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that
is to be sent." So Judah has still a... but soon after it loses its...
And all the tribes were confused and Judah was of no significance any longer,
except of course, Judah gave its name to Judea and Judaic, Judaism. All of
those words for Jewishness today are taken from the tribe of Judah.

Numbers 24:17. This is Balaam, the pagan Balaam, prophesying concerning Israel.
Balaam was summoned by King Balak to curse Israel. He stood on a mountain
overlooking the hosts of Israel and he opened his mouth and instead of curses
coming out, blessings came out, which didn't greatly please Balak. Verse 17,
"'I shall see him, but not now, I shall behold him, but not near, a star shall
rise out of Jacob, and a scepter shall spring up from Israel, and shall strike
the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth. And he shall
possess Edom.'" Right, this is the star of Jacob. He will enlighten. The
Messiah will enlighten the world. A star shall rise. The Messiah will enlighten
the world. He will hold a scepter. He's going to be a king of a kingdom.
Numbers 24, verse 17, "A scepter shall spring up from Israel and shall strike
the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth." The Messiah
will break up God's enemies. Of course, that we know has a spiritual meaning.
The Jews, by the scribes and Pharisees, by the time of our Lord, gave it, of
course, a materialistic meaning. But you and I know that it has a spiritual
meaning. The best of the Jewish interpreters will also have given it a
spiritual meaning. But that spiritual meaning was progressively lost down to
the time of our Lord himself, by when they were expecting nothing more nor
less than somebody to smash the Romans. That's what they wanted Jesus to be.
That's what they couldn't forgive him for not being, and that's why they
crucified him for not being. So, the Messiah will break up the enemies of God.

Deuteronomy 18:15-18. This is Moses speaking, Moses instructing the people.
This is Moses talking to the Israelites, how they must behave amongst the
pagans. Verse 15, "The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a prophet of thy
nation and of thy brethren, like unto me, him thou shalt hear. As thou
desirest of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assembly was gathered
together and saidst, 'Let me not hear any more the voice of the Lord my
God, neither let me see anymore this exceeding great fire, lest I die.'"
Verse 18, "'I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their
brethren, like to thee, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall
speak to them all that I shall command him. And he that will not hear his
words, which he shall speak in my name, I will be the revenger.'" That's
verses 15 to 19 of Deuteronomy Chapter 18. This is Moses talking about,
prophesying the Messiah. The Messiah is going to be the supreme prophet.
"I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren. I will
put my words in his mouth and he shall speak to them all that I shall command
him. Him thou shalt hear." The Messiah is going to be the supreme prophet.
He will be a liberator, mediator, and legislator like Moses. But he will
surpass Moses because Moses will listen to him. "Him thou shalt hear. The
Lord thy God will raise up to thee a prophet of thy nation and of thy brethren
like unto me. Him thou shalt hear." Moses himself is going to listen to this
prophet, so he will be the supreme prophet, liberator, mediator, and
legislator like Moses, but surpassing Moses.

You know why the Jews thought that the prophet was going to be a different
person? They expected him to be a sort of superman. They had a thoroughly
materialistic view of the Messiah by the time the Messiah came, and the pure
doctrine of the Old Testament was corrupted by the scribes and Pharisees.
Out of pride and nationalism and arrogance, "We're going to rise up and
smash the Gentiles and take over the world as we deserve to," right? That's
the main reason why they refused him. That would cause them to think that
the prophet was another... But you see, John, "Art thou the prophet?" It was
the gospel of the first Sunday of, the second Sunday of Advent. "Art thou
the prophet?" It's exactly this prophecy. "Art thou Elias? Art thou...
And they asked him, 'What then? Art thou Elias?' He said, 'I'm not.'
'Art thou the prophet?' And he answered, 'No.'" That's John 1:21, right?
"Art thou the prophet?" So they were expecting the prophet. Because of the
chronology and the prophecy of Daniel, they were expecting the Messiah
around the time of Christ, and several false messiahs had already arisen.
Why did they not believe that he was the Messiah? Another thing, he came
from Galilee. I mean, nobody, if there's anybody, comes from Galilee.
Galilee is the pits. That's another reason, seriously, why they didn't,
they never... What good can come out of Galilee?

Richard: Why did they think that the prophet would be different from the
conquering Christ? Did they think it would be two different people?
Bishop Williamson: Why did they think the prophet would be different from the
conquering Christ? I don't see the... What makes you say they would be, that
they separated the two?
Richard: From three specific passages before this... They asked John about
two passages. You said it was not the Christ. Then they said, "Why, are you
not the Christ?"
Bishop Williamson: They, the Jews have got various sort of expectations.
The Messiah is the anointed one, so, "Are you the Messiah?" Then he says no.
Then, "Are you the prophet?" The prophet might be different, might be
different from the Messiah. Might. Now, we, we... And of course, the
prophecies were only absolutely clear after the event. We now know clearly
that the one that Moses is talking about is the Messiah, right? But they,
the Jews are covering all their bases by asking all of the, you know, "Who?
Just in case." It's said clearly that here that the prophet will be the Messiah.

## Davidic Times

All right. Davidic times, the Books of Kings and the Psalms. 1 Samuel,
2 Samuel, three Kings, four Kings, and the Psalms. 1 Samuel 2:10. "The
adversaries of the Lord shall fear him. And upon them shall he thunder
in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall
give empire to his king and shall exalt the horn of his Christ." This is
the Canticle of Anna. Anna was the barren woman who went up to the temple
always in tears and the priest finally said to her, "What's the trouble,
mom?" And she said, "Well, I'm not mom. I need a child." So the priest said,
"All right. Don't worry. Just go on praying and I'm sure the Lord will hear
you." And sure enough, she became pregnant. She's pregnant with Samuel,
and she speaks a canticle of joy at having at last conceived a son, which
is the model of the Magnificat of the Mother of God. Only the Old Testament
Magnificat is longer and it's more complicated, but it's definitely...
it's very clearly an influence. So, the Mother of God, expecting the Messiah,
follows her predecessor, Anna. And it's interesting to compare the two.
The New Testament... the Magnificat of the Mother of God is rather simpler,
but there is clearly a connection. So, Anna prophesies.

2 Samuel 7:12-16. This is the Lord God instructing the prophet Nathan what
he is to tell David. And Nathan is to tell David, "From the day that I
appointed judges over my people Israel," this is verse 11, "I will give
thee rest from all thy enemies and the law foretelleth to thee that the Lord
will make thee a house. And when thy days shall be fulfilled..." This is
Nathan speaking to David. "David, when your life is over, and thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers, I, the Lord God, will raise up thy seed after thee,
David, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his
kingdom." Therefore, this verse says that the Messiah is going to be the son
of David. It's a very important point. The Messiah will be a child of David.
He'll be a descendant of David. We had a descendant of Abraham, a descendant
of Isaac, a descendant of Jacob. 2 Samuel, which is two kings. 2 Samuel 7:12.
"Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers. I will raise up thy seed after thee,
which shall proceed out of thy bowels, out of thy loins, and I will establish
his kingdom. I, God, will establish the kingdom of the Messiah of thy son."
Challoner notes, "This prophecy partly related to Solomon, but much more
to Christ, who is called the Son of David in Scripture and who is the builder
of the true temple, which is the church's everlasting kingdom, which shall
never fail." That's an example of a prophecy with a double fulfillment.
And the first minor fulfillment was Solomon, the immediate son of David,
whose kingdom was established by God. The Jewish kingdom was... The kingdom
of Israel was never as great as it was under Solomon. But it's more
importantly a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ. "And He shalt be in the
house to my name, and I will establish the throne of His kingdom forever.
I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to me a Son. And if He commit
any iniquity, I'll correct Him with a rod of men, with the stripes of the
children of men." That obviously doesn't refer to our Lord. "But my mercy,
I will not take away from us. I took it from Saul, whom I removed from,
from before my face. Thy house shall be faithful and Thy kingdom forever
before Thy face, and Thy throne shall be firm forever." Wow, verse 16.
That's the prophecy of the eternal kingdom of Jesus. It doesn't... It's...
The kingdom of Solomon was not eternal. The Jews lost it in 70 A.D. But that
verse 16... Verse 14 applies to Solomon, and it doesn't apply to Jesus.
Verse 16 applies to Jesus, and it doesn't apply to Solomon. According to all
these words and visions, so did Nathan speak to David.

## The Prophets

Thirdly, the prophets. Four major prophets and 12 minor prophets given here
in chronological order. Firstly, Joel. Joel 2:28-32. Famous prophecy, Peter
on Pentecost. "It shall come to pass after this that I will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.
Your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
Moreover, upon my servants and handmaids in those days I shall pour forth
my spirit, and I will show wonders in heaven and in earth, blood and fire,
and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into
blood before the great and dreadful day the Lord doth come. And it shall
come to pass that everyone that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall
be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord
has said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call." Joel 2:28-32.
The Messiah will come for all men of all races, classes, and conditions.
Everyone that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. He will
come for all men of all races, classes, and conditions. He will accomplish
great prodigies in sun and moon. The sun shall be turned into darkness and
the moon into blood. He will accomplish great prodigies in sun and moon,
and all who call on him will be saved.

Another famous prophecy, next in chronological order, Micah 5:2-5. "And now
Bethlehem Ephratah are too little among the thousands of Judah. Out of these
shall he come forth unto me, that is to be the ruler in Israel, and his going
forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity. Therefore will he give
them up even till the time wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth and
the remnant of his brethren shall be converted to the children of Israel.
And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the height of the
name of the Lord his God, and they shall be converted, for now shall he be
magnified even to the ends of the earth." "And this man shall be our peace
when the Assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall set his foot in
our houses, and we shall raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal
men." The Messiah will be born of woman in Bethlehem. "Therefore will he give
them up, even till the time wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth."
Of course, the Mother of God did not travail in the normal sense, but still.
He will be born of woman in Bethlehem, and his reign will be peaceful.
"And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the height of
the name of the Lord his God, and they shall be converted, for now shall he
be magnified even to the ends of the earth, and this man shall be our peace."
Verse 5, "When the Assyrian shall come into our land, this man shall be our
peace." The king of peace. So he's going to be born of woman, born in Bethlehem.
This prophecy is what made the Pharisees in Jerusalem know where to send the
Magi when the Magi following the star came to Jerusalem and said, "Where is
he born?" And so the Pharisees said, "Well, he's, it's in... the Messiah's
going to be born in Bethlehem." "Thank you very much," said the Magi. Off
they went. That's the... here's the prophecy that told the authorities in
Jerusalem where to send the Magi.

Isaiah, there the quotations abound. Isaiah, the dates of Isaiah? Around 700
BC. Isaiah 2, verses 2 to 4. Again, a famous prophecy about the Church, the
Catholic Church. "In the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord
shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above
the hills and all nations shall flow unto it." That's the Catholic Church.
"And many people should go and say, 'Come and let us go up to the mountain
of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his
ways and we will walk in his paths.' For the Lord shall come forth from
Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem." Spiritual Zion, spiritual
Jerusalem. "And he shall judge the Gentiles and rebuke many people, and they
shall turn their swords into plowshares and their spears into sickles. Nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any
more to war." Again, a kingdom of peace. Isaiah 2. When he comes, when the
Messiah comes, the nations will recognize the true God. When the Messiah
comes, the nations will recognize the true God. The nations understand the
Gentiles. The Gentiles will recognize the true God and will flock to Mount
Zion, at least in a spiritual sense. They will flock to the Catholic Church,
from where God's law will spread over the whole earth. How many of you, hands
up all those of you who already knew that prophecy, as being a prophecy? Only
two of you, three of you. And I'm glad because... Have you not learned it in
apologetics? You did learn this in apologetics. Hands up those of you that
have done apologetics. I thought we only learned apologetics for the sake
of the exams?

Isaiah 4:2-6. "In that day, the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and
glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them
that shall have escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass that everyone
that shall be left in Zion and that shall remain in Jerusalem shall be called
holy, everyone that is written in life in Jerusalem. If the Lord shall wash
away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall wash away the blood of
Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, by the spirit
of burning. And the Lord will create upon every place of Mount Zion, and where
he is called upon, a cloud by day and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming
fire in the night. For over all the glory shall be a protection." It's
obviously a reference to Exodus, the pillar of fire, the desert. "And there
shall be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat and for security
and cover from the whirlwind and from rain." So, 4:2-6. The age of the Messiah
will be of an age of unheard of glory and splendor for the remnant of Israel.
The age of the Messiah will be an age of unheard of glory and splendor for
the remnant of Israel. The remnant. Joseph of Arimathea, Saint Joseph,
Nicodemus, Gamaliel, who else? All the apostles, not even Judas Iscariot,
a handful, a remnant amongst all of the people in... amongst all of the
dwellers in Jerusalem. Well, there were then 2, 3,000 or 5,000 under Saint
Peter. "In that day, the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory."
That's the beginning of the Catholic Church. "And the fruit of the earth
shall be high and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel."
That will have escaped out of Phariseeism, that will have got out of the
falsification of the Mosaic religion. "It should come to pass that everyone
that should be left in Zion, that they shall remain in Jerusalem." That all
of those who are still in the spiritual Zion, the spiritual Jerusalem, shall
be called holy, everyone that is written in life in Jerusalem, everyone in
the book of life. And not many of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were in the
book of life. "If the Lord should wash away the filth of the doors, he'll
wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst, there by the spirit of
burning. The Lord will create upon every place of Mount Zion and where he
is called upon a cloud by day and a smoke in the brightness of a flaming
fire in the night." This is a figure of the glory of the Catholic Church,
which is going to lead Jews and the remnant of Israel and all the nations.
"And there should be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat or
for security to cover from the whirlwind from the rain." It's a splendid
messianic prophecy. The holy city, purified of its bloodshed... Understand
the Catholic Church. "Purified of its bloodshed will be inhabited only by
the just. God will protect it with his power, cover it with his glory, protect
it against all perils." If you think of the Catholic Church, it's as clear
as daylight. The Pharisees obviously were applying all of that, once more,
in a materialistic sense. Thus, "The holy city, purified of bloodshed, will
be inhabited only by the just. God will protect it with his power, cover it
with his glory, and shield it against all perils."

Isaiah 7:14-15. Famous prophecy. "Therefore, the Lord Himself shall give you
a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son. His name shall be
called Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse
the evil and to choose the good." 7:14-15. His mother will be a virgin. His
name will be Emmanuel, meaning God with us. Raphael, Michael, Gabriel,
Emmanuel, El is God. God with us. He will be subject to the laws of human
nature. "He should eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse evil and
choose the good." Slight mysterious verse, but he will be subject to the
laws of human nature.

Isaiah 9:1-5. "At the first time, the land of Zabulon and the land of Nephi
was lightly touched, and at the last, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of
the gallery of the Gentiles was heavily loaded. The people that walked in
darkness have seen a great light. To them that dwells in the region of the
shadow of death, death's light is risen. Thou hast multiplied the nation,
thou hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee as they that
rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey when they
divide the spoils." The Messiah will especially illuminate the territory of
Naphtali and Zabulon. Those are two of the tribes of Israel and their
territory corresponds to the territory of Naphtali and Zabulon. The territory
of Naphtali and Zabulon, what's the territory of Naphtali and Zabulon? Two
tribes? Galilee. Galilee is right, yes. Galilee is the later name for that
territory. Naphtali and Zabulon is the two tribes that originally occupied
the area of Galilee when the Israelites moved into the Holy Land.

I think there's a, the class on Monday, we will cover that much more of the, 
of these messianic prophecies.
