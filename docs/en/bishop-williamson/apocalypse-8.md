Bishop Williamson deciphers the trumpets of Apocalypse Chapters 8 and 9,
linking ancient prophecies to the corruption of doctrine by heresiarchs, the
ensuing spiritual decline within the Church, and the characteristics of the
modern crisis, a prelude to the end times.

# Apocalypse 8 & 9: Trumpets of Corruption and Modernist Locusts

Bishop Williamson explains Apocalypse 8's first four trumpets as preaching
generations. He says the third trumpet signifies 4th-century doctors and "fallen
star" heresiarchs (like Arius or moderns such as John Courtney Murray) who corrupt
patristic scriptural interpretation ("waters") with bitter heresy ("Wormwood"),
noting "revolution eats its own children." He interprets the fourth trumpet as later
doctors whose preaching reveals the failure of many clergy ("sun, moon, stars") to
sanctify, while an eagle's "Woe" forewarns materialists.

Moving to Chapter 9, he identifies the fifth trumpet with our era: the devil
("fallen star") unleashes modernist "locusts" and heresy ("smoke"), obscuring
Christ ("sun") and faith ("air"). Bishop Williamson decries liberalism's dismissal
of heresy's gravity, contrasting it with liberalism's own "inquisition" (political
correctness) fueled by media, finance, and appeals to concupiscence. He concludes
that despite the Church's mysterious prolonged decline, God's ultimate purpose,
saving souls, continues.

## Chapter 8: The First Four Trumpets

Chapter 8 is short but quite difficult. The first four trumpets signify seven
generations of preaching in the Church. The seven seals were like seven episodes
or stages in the history of the Church. The seven trumpets represent seven
generations of preaching.
The first was the apostles at the very beginning, apostles to the Jews.
Secondly, apostles to the Gentiles all over the world. Thirdly, the great
doctors of the 4th century. And the fourth trumpet signifies doctors from the
4th century down to the period of the Antichrist. It is not too easy.

### The Third Trumpet: Heresiarchs and Poisoned Waters

We were on verse 10. Verse 8 was the second angel and the second trumpet.
Verse 10 refers to the third angel: the doctors of the 4th century, which is
the great generation of Church doctors. "And the third angel sounded his
trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning like a torch."
A great star represents the heresiarchs, like Arius, the leaders of heresies,
the leading heretics. "Arch" signifies a leader.

"And it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of water.
And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third part of the waters
became wormwood, and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter."
The heresiarchs are "burning like a torch," not like a serene star, but like a
smoky torch burning itself out. They have their day of brilliance. For instance,
John Courtney Murray, the writer of the Declaration of Religious Liberty, had
his day. When he returned to the United States, he expected heroic treatment,
but within a few years, he was passé, finished. The revolution had left him
far behind.

This relates to the conservatives at each stage of a revolution, who want the
revolution to go only so far and no further. Once their point is reached, they
desire it to level out, forming a new conservatism for that stage. Vatican II,
like all revolutions, was a downward thrust with its own conservatism. Ratzinger
is a conservative of the revolution, while Hans Küng wants the revolution to
continue. When revolutionaries speak of the "spirit of Vatican II," they mean a
constantly changing Mass. They are basically right; that was its spirit. It is
useless to hold up the letter of Vatican II against its spirit because the letter
was not designed to hold up. The famous proverb states, "The revolution eats its
own children." It always generates another stage and rolls on. John Courtney
Murray expected heroic treatment, but within two years, he was old hat. He died
in 1967, quite soon after the council. Heresiarchs are brilliant for a short
while, then crash like a shooting star into the sea.

"And it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of water."
The "rivers" can be understood in three parts: the first is the Old Testament,
the second is the New Testament, and the third part is the Church Fathers.
The leaders of heretics "fell upon" the Church Fathers. Heretics pretended to
accept Scripture but attacked its interpretation by the Church Fathers, thereby
perverting Scripture's sense. The "rivers and waters" are what Catholics drink.
Heretics fall upon this third part, poisoning the waters of Catholic piety,
the wellsprings of Catholic piety, and the interpretation of Scripture.
Modernists did exactly this at Vatican II and before, poisoning Scripture and
making it unreadable.

The star of these heretics is called "Absinthe" (Wormwood), which is very
bitter, because heresy is bitter in its consequences. It is sweet on the tongue
but poison in the stomach, whereas Catholic truth can be rough on the tongue but
is honey in the stomach. Thus, a third part of the waters – the Church Fathers'
interpretations – is turned into absinthe. "And many men died of those waters";
many Catholics perish from the poisoning of the living waters of tradition. This
is what Protestants, liberals, and neo-modernists have done.
I have mentioned how Ratzinger, in his formation, was influenced by Catholic
priests and professors who were themselves too much influenced by Protestant
"Scripture scholars," particularly German ones, who did considerable damage.
There are few English Scripture scholars of comparable clout.

Many Catholics perish because the living waters of tradition are poisoned with
bitterness. Heresy gives rise to war, Protestantism being a classic case.
The Arian heresy also led to fighting. After Constantine died, the Roman Empire
was divided, partly along lines of Arians versus Christians. Religion, or rather
heresy, is of the devil, who will never leave Christians in peace. If the devil
gains many followers, he will use them to attack Catholics, leading to war.
Catholics will have to defend themselves, as seen with Protestantism.

### The Fourth Trumpet: Fading Shepherds and Spiritual Darkness

Verse 12 describes the fourth angel, representing doctors from the 4th century
down to the end times. "The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and the third part
of the sun was struck, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the
stars, so that the third part of them was obscured, darkened, and the third part
of the day did not shine, and likewise the night."

The sun, moon, and stars here represent prelates (bishops, nuncios, cardinals),
priests, and religious appointed to feed the flock. When the doctors throughout
these intervening centuries sound their trumpet of Catholic preaching, a whole
portion of these prelates, priests, and religious are "struck."
Of these shepherds, one part sanctifies self and others (the saints). A second
part sanctifies only others, doing their job for the flock but not their own
souls. A third part sanctifies neither. It is this third part that fades out.
These prelates, priests, and religious who sanctify neither themselves nor
others simply fade under the blast of the doctors' preaching down the centuries.
A third part of the sun, moon, and stars was darkened.

An example could be the end of the Middle Ages, where many such priests faded
from the picture as the torch was picked up by a new generation of priests and
prelates of the Counter-Reformation. St. Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan,
was a crackerjack. He made everyone in his archdiocese shape up or ship out. He
shook his archdiocese onto its feet. Dying in his 40s, he had achieved
extraordinary things and was the model Tridentine bishop. He played a large part
in getting the Council of Trent picked up again after its suspension. He was
instrumental in getting the Pope to conclude it. He certainly reformed the
Archdiocese of Milan, making no-good priests get on their feet. He was a great
administrator, a cardinal at 22, nephew of Pope Pius IV, which made him
Cardinal of Milan. This was nepotism working the right way for once. He was one
of the first to make the decrees of Trent truly work. He was also instrumental
in the Roman Catechism, which originated from a committee he led.

The Church continually needs new impetus because human nature, priests and laity
alike, tends to slip back and needs revival. Some shepherds look after
themselves and their flocks, some only the flocks, some neither. Those who look
after neither fade out when the doctors sound their trumpets. When this third
part "did not shine by day nor by night," the flock, with their clergy faded,
had light neither for good works by day nor for faith by night. Faith is light
in darkness; it believes what it does not see. So, the people with this fading
clergy lacked light for good works and for faith. This fourth trumpet offers a
brief account of those intervening centuries.

### Prelude to the Final Woes: The Eagle's Cry

The Book of the Apocalypse is mainly concerned with events at the end of the
world. We have briefly covered verses on the Church's beginnings, just one for
all the middle centuries, and now we approach the end. Verse 13 is a warning:
"And I saw and I heard the voice of an eagle flying through the middle of heaven,
saying with a great voice, 'Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by
reason of the rest of the voices of three angels who are yet to sound the
trumpet.'" This verse is a brief preamble marking the terribleness of the
Church's struggles at the end of the world, for the fifth, sixth, and seventh
trumpets.

The eagle here symbolizes all who penetrate deep into God's mysteries (in Latin,
"deep" is similar to "high," so a high-flying eagle). Flying above earthly
concerns, this penetrator of God's mysteries cries out "Woe." The woe falls upon
the "earth dwellers," those held down by earthly concerns – materialists.
Someone who sees into God's mysteries can foresee the woe awaiting those caught
in materialism at the end of their world.
Regarding whether the eagle refers to St. John the Evangelist (whose symbol is
an eagle), it is unlikely, as John says, "I saw and I heard," implying he would
be seeing himself. This interpretation of Apocalypse, much of it, could perhaps
be deduced with enough time, thought, and inspiration, as the monks of the
Middle Ages had. It often makes sense through deduction and cross-referencing.

## Chapter 9: The Fifth Trumpet and the Rise of Modernism

Chapter 9 describes our own times; it is an extraordinary portrait of modernists
and easy to apply to them today. They are like grasshoppers with scorpion
stings, hair like women, and making sounds like tanks.

"The fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the
earth: and there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened
the bottomless pit; and the smoke of the pit arose as the smoke of a great
furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit. And
from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was
given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power... they should not hurt
the grass... but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads...
torment them five months... their torment was as the torment of a scorpion...
men seek death, and not find it...
The shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle. On their
heads as it were crowns like gold: their faces were as the faces of men; they
had hair as the hair of women; their teeth were as lions': they had breastplates
like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was as the noise of
chariots and many horses running to battle. They had tails like the scorpions,
and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five
months: and they had over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose
name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek Apollyon, and in Latin Exterminans.
One woe is past; and, behold, there come yet two woes more hereafter."

### The Devil Unleashes Heresy

The fifth trumpet (verses 1-11) is the first of these three woes. The fifth
angel represents preachers against the heretics who herald the Antichrist, the
forerunners of the Antichrist. We could be in this period today; it feels like a
dress rehearsal for the Antichrist.

"And I saw a star fall from Heaven upon Earth, and there was given to it the key
of the pit of the abyss." The star is the devil, long since fallen. Our Lord
said (Luke 10:18), "I saw Satan like lightning falling from Heaven." He told the
72 disciples not to rejoice that spirits were subject to them (extraordinary
graces of ministry, *gratiae gratis datae*), but that their names were written
in Heaven (sanctifying grace, *gratia sanctificans*), which is what gets one to
Heaven. The devil had many talents but still crashed. So, being a "star" does
not save.
Isaiah 14:12 also speaks of Lucifer's fall: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
weaken the nations!"

The fallen star, the devil, was given "the key of the pit of the abyss," meaning
God allowed the devil to make heretics open up all heresy. The devil cannot act
without God's permission. He stirs up heresy from hell, taking hold of humans,
often Catholic priests (most great heretics were, alas), and filling them with
heretical thoughts.

### The Smoke of Heresy Obscuring Christ and Faith

"He opened the pit of the abyss and there arose smoke from the pit like smoke of
a great furnace." Smoke represents blinding, suffocating heresy, recalling St.
Ignatius's two standards and the smoky throne of Satan. Many die in fires from
suffocation by smoke. This smoke is like that "of a great furnace," the furnace
being the Antichrist himself. So, it is heresy as of the Antichrist.
"And the sun was obscured and the air, from the smoke of the pit." The sun here
is Christ, "the light of the world," obscured by heresy. The air is faith, the
breath of spiritual life, made unbreathable by heresy. Christ is made
unseeable, and faith unbreathable.

### The Modern Mind and the Gravity of Heresy

A massive disability of the modern mind is its inability to appreciate what
heresy is. Liberalism dictates that heresy does not matter. Everyone must be
free to think and say what they like; no belief is truer than another;
contradictory beliefs are equally valuable if they make one feel good. Tolerance
of others' idiocies is paramount. Sincerity and tolerance become the great
liberal virtues. What one actually thinks is irrelevant in non-material things.
Truth in such matters is deemed inaccessible, unreliable, and valueless.
Consequently, the gravity of error, of heresy, completely escapes the modern
mind. People today have no idea how grave heresy is, a stark contrast to how
the Church historically worried about and pursued it with an Inquisition.
Today, the Inquisition is seen as the worst evil, showing a huge reversal of
values. People automatically live by the liberal system: down with Inquisition
and censorship, up with "liberty," without a second thought.

### The "Inquisition" of Liberalism and Political Correctness

Yet, liberal society has its own strict censorship. Try selling a book denying
the Holocaust or publicly stating certain views about women or other groups,
and see the reaction. If you are politically incorrect, the response is severe.
Where does the power of this "politically correct inquisition" come from? They
claim to have no censorship and absolute freedom, but it is not true. There is
no freedom to question democracy, among many other things.
Where does this power of the liberal inquisition originate? Some suggest herd
instinct or the weakness of Catholics. The media also play a significant role.

### The Power of Media and Human Weakness

Where do the media get their clout? From financial power, certainly. Money
merchants ensure they control the media. But money is an instrument, not the
ultimate answer. For instance, rock music is not popular simply because it is
financed; finance follows rock music because it sells.
The media derive their power from playing to the weaknesses of human nature:
the triple concupiscence. They flatter people's pride (your opinion matters,
you vote, you are sovereign). Sensuality is constantly appealed to. The
concupiscence of the eyes is fed by catalogs of worldly glory (glorious houses,
furnishings). If people were virtuous, the media would lose this power and have
to change their tune. If people were not materialistic, glossy advertisements
would lose their kick.
The degradation of TV has evolved with, and led, the degradation of the people,
though it cannot get too far ahead without protest. If the people were to
convert, TV degradation would stop overnight.

## Divine Providence and the Church's Decline

Why does God allow the Church to go downhill for 400-500 years, ever since the
Counter-Reformation? It is one of those questions with many answers.
Perhaps when confession sticks and more heretics are present, there is more
glory to God in a downward-rolling situation.
Will there actually be fewer souls saved under the Counter-Reformation than in
the Middle Ages? Consider population growth: France had perhaps 15-20 million
in the Middle Ages, now over 50 million. England had about 4 million, now
around 55 million. It is perfectly possible, though speculative and part of
God's mysteries, that as many or more souls have been saved in the Counter-
Reformation centuries. We will only know on the Last Day.
What is not speculation is that the purpose of this Earth, in any age, is the
salvation of souls through the Catholic Church. Ages evolve differently, but the
perspective for examining an age is not whether it was pleasant, but whether
souls were being saved. Even under the persecution of the Antichrist, souls
will still be saved.
