Bishop Williamson contrasts Catholic teaching on distinct God-given natures 
of men (head) & women (heart), their roles in marriage & family leadership, 
and the principle of authority (distinguishing office/person) with modern 
liberal & Rousseauist ideas that damage individuals & society.

# Authority, Society, and Gender Roles

Bishop Williamson contrasts God-given authority with Rousseau's social contract,
emphasizing distinguishing the sacred office from the flawed person holding it,
a principle seen in priesthood and papacy. 

He links this to God granting secondary causality and touches on 
suffering for good. He critiques modern
views on slavery, calling sin the ultimate evil and noting hidden modern
slavery. He contrasts the God-given natures of men (logic) and women
(intuition/heart), viewing women in male roles as unnatural and feminism as
protest. 

Catholic marriage needs these distinct roles, with men leading and
women needing love/attention while men need respect. He advises men: listen,
love, lead. In 1 Peter 3 exegesis, he interprets Christ preaching in limbo as
announcing redemption and explains the flood/baptism analogy (few saved by
water) and baptism as a spiritual sacrament.

## Introduction and Recap of St. Peter's Epistle

I should be away for the next three scripture periods, Thursday,
Monday, Tuesday. Father Escarra proposed this. I will also teach
this afternoon, though if we finish 1 Peter by this afternoon, then
I think you'll get a little break because I may not have time to
prepare anything further. We were in the middle of the special duties
of Christians. We were looking at the, in verses 11 and 12, "Let the
good example of Christians dispel the calumnies of the pagans."

## On Society and Authority

13 to 17, "Let Christians be subject to the authorities." That text
is a source of that Catholic doctrine of respect for and submission
to the civil authorities. And a Catholic is always making the
distinction between the man and the institution, between the authority
as authority and the authority as a human being. The authority as a
human being can always make the most awful mistakes, but the
principle of authority remains intact.

You know that because man has a social nature, God creates the social
part of that social nature. The socialness of man's social nature comes
from God. It's absolutely integrated with the individualness of his
human nature. The individualness and the familialness and the socialness
of human nature are three integrated aspects; they're not three
separate chunks. It's the whole of human nature which is both
individual and familial and social. So the socialness of human nature
is absolutely integrated into human nature. That human nature comes
from God, socialness comes from God. Therefore, society comes from
God.

Contrast Rousseau: society is an artificial thing which the noble
savage only gets into trouble with when he walks out of his noble
forest. Fantasy, absolute fantasy, but it's a key fantasy. To deny
the socialness of man is to create this insane individualistic world
which is part of what's got into these kids in Littleton. Living in
these individualistic suburban homes, not forming part of any decent
society, of any human society, with no proper expression for their
socialness. That's bad news. It's going to twist and frustrate in the
depths.

Therefore, society comes from God. Now, society absolutely needs
authority, therefore the principle of authority comes from God. The
need of authority comes from God. Therefore, authority is of God. That's
exactly what Paul says, exactly what Peter says. Whereas the modern
world, authority comes purely from human beings. It's radically
false, radically false, that if human beings live in society, it's
purely by an agreement amongst themselves, the social contract. Fantasy,
dangerous and deadly fantasy.

In my judgment, you're lucky to have had Rousseau really taken to the
cleans in front of you, because he is kind of the key to the modern
world. Dr. Winowski, who is down at St. Mary's, taught down the hill
before. He used to come up here for Mass, and that's how he finally got
to St. Mary's. He was down the hill and I asked him once, you know, I
thought he may have written it, what is the number one influence down
the hill? He said, "Rousseau." The number one influence on all the
madness going on in all of these stupid, crazy quote unquote
universities, Rousseau. Rousseau, number one. All the madness of the
modern world kind of funnels through that poor crazy man.

## Distinguishing the Office from the Person

So, the principle of authority comes from God. Of course, these are all,
you know, Catholics understand. Catholics understand the weakness of
human nature and the sacredness of authority. They understand both
principles. That's why Catholics are constantly distinguishing between
the poor human being who is in a position of authority and the sacred
principle of which he is, for as long as he is the authority, the
carrier. Priests make, Catholics make that distinction particularly
about priests. The priesthood is sacred even if this particular priest
is a wretched sinner.

The mistake, if you don't distinguish between those two formal aspects
of the same material being—this human being taken materially is both
a priest and a sinner—if you don't distinguish between the priest and
the poor sinner, then either you're going to make sin stick to the
priesthood, and then when he commits a sin, you throw the whole faith
out of the window, which is a deadly mistake. Or you make the priesthood
stick to the sin, that is to say since he's a priest then it's not
really a sin what he's doing. You've got to distinguish the two, and
distinguish all the time between those two formal aspects, the two
formalities of one material thing or human being, whatever it is.

So, for instance, you've got the pope. Materially, he's just one being,
he's one man. He's got two legs, two arms, one head. He's about 78 years
old, he's Polish and so on. That's taken materially. Taken formally,
then there is the Vicar of Christ and the humanly hopeless dreamer,
the hopeless dreamer. There are the two things. Now, if you don't
separate the two, if you make the dreamer stick to the Vicar of Christ,
you'll become a Liberal. Because you will say that this dream comes
from Christ, the dream of ecumenism, the dream of religious liberty,
the dream of building Orthodox churches for the Romanians... That's
the latest, last weekend or the weekend before. He goes there and
promises a bunch of Vatican money to help the Romanian Orthodox to
build Orthodox churches. I mean, you know. If you fasten the dream to
Christ, you'll become a Liberal. That is to say, you will say that this
dream is...

On the other hand, if you fasten Christ to the dream, if you say that
Christ is attached to the dream, then of course you become a Sedevacantist
because you say that it's absolutely impossible for Christ to back this
dream, therefore he's not the Vicar of Christ. He is the Vicar of Christ
because he is a poor human being at the same time that he is in
authority. The formality of his being in authority, the formality of
the Vicar of Christ, is different from the formality of his poor
weaknesses as a human being.

Why does the Lord God choose to entrust authority, either civil or
ecclesiastical, to poor human beings, especially in His Church, knowing
that it is going to be poor sinners to whom the authority is going to
be entrusted? That's our Lord's choice. That's His decision. He could
have instituted... He could have arranged for the Church to be governed
by angels. You can imagine, I mean, the Lord God is God, He could easily
have done it that way. But then we would... Human, all human beings
would have been directed by angels openly and obviously.

What's the famous principle of Saint Thomas for the reason why our Lord
founds the priesthood of poor human beings? Our Lord became man, that's
for sure. If the supreme high priest took human nature, it's normal that
the following priests would be human beings. On the other hand, you
might say it's abnormal since the supreme high priest was sinless, it's
abnormal that He should choose priests who would be sinful. He might
just as well say, "Since the supreme high priest was sinless, then He
ought to put His Church in the hands of sinless angels." So, the argument
is not conclusive.

Nor is Saint Thomas' argument conclusive, but Saint Thomas' argument
is extremely interesting, and it's a principle that applies way outside
of just why He takes human beings to be priests. He wishes to confer
upon creatures the dignity of secondary causality, that's right. He wants
to... If the Lord God could run the whole universe by Himself, and you
might say, "If He did it Himself, it would be well-run." But in that
case, everybody would be just moved as opposed to mover. The Lord God
would do all the moving, directing, deciding, and everybody would be
just pawns on the board, so to speak. We'd all be just shuffled around.
It would be an impeccable shuffle, but it would be only a shuffle. We
would all be doing a divine shoe shuffle all the way to heaven, and that's
all we would be doing.

The Lord God wishes to bestow upon His creatures the dignity of
causality. And if those causes, those secondary causes are human beings,
then we're talking about human dignity. Well, there it is, but only
in Saint Thomas, it's the real McCoy, as opposed to this dummy Russoist
substitute of today. I can't remember if that's in the treatise on the
priesthood. It's certainly towards the end of the Prima Pars, in the
whole treatise, the whole section on the governance of creatures,
Gubernatio Creaturarum, it must come up front. In other words, it's the
heart of question 103 of the Prima Pars. I'm sure it'll be there.

The Prima Pars is question one which is sacred doctrine. Then 2 to 26
is Deo Uno, and of course 27 to 43 is Deo Trino. 44 to 49 is Deo Creatore.
So that's all God. And then we come into creatures, the section on
creatures, which is principally the angels, 50 to 64, and then 65 to
102, man, those funny, extraordinary, desperate creatures called man.
Sophocles says, "There are many strange things but none stranger than
man." In Lancashire you've heard me quote, "There's nowt so queer as
folk." The last part is the governance of creation, and that's 103 through
to the end, which is 119. Here the governance... the governing of
creatures in general, and then the governing as carried out by angels,
and then as carried out by men, and finally as carried out by things,
as I recall. And that's where you get the question on faith towards the
end, the question, "Do the stars govern us?" The answer is of course,
no they don't. But up here must be the principles of why God entrusts
the government of the universe to creatures. In other words, He puts
His own government into the hands of creatures because He wishes creatures
to have the dignity of causality.

Same principle behind the priesthood. Same principle behind all civil
authority. Obviously the Lord God foresaw that human beings are going
to misuse their authority. Shakespeare: "Dress up a man in a little
authority and just see what fantastical high tricks he plays." This
line is spoken by Isabella in *Measure for Measure* (Act II, Scene 2),
referring to Angelo, the temporary deputy who abuses his power.

So obviously God foresaw that civil authorities, and much worse,
ecclesiastical authorities, are going to play fantastical high tricks,
but it's still worth it. The upside still outweighs the downside. Even
if, like with the salvation of souls, even if it's the great number
of souls that go to hell, still it's worth creating them all for the
sake of those relatively few that get to heaven. Even if a number of
priests misuse their authority, it's still worth creating a human
priesthood for the sake of those relatively few who make the use of
the priesthood that the Lord God intended, who respond to His invitation
to make the right use of the enormous authority and responsibility
that He puts in their hands.

Our Lord once said to Saint Teresa of Avila, I think, He said, "I would
have created the whole of creation just for you." So the Lord God works
with quality and not with quantity, and therefore He will... even if
the majority of popes misuse their authority, still if there are a few
that got it right, the Lord God, the way He operates, would still have
instituted a human papacy for the benefit of those who would freely
make the right use of His gifts, as opposed to those who freely make
the wrong use of His gifts.

So therefore, the Catholic principle of authority, of respectful
authority, which goes clean against the whole modern world, which is
built on Rousseau, which is built on individualism, built on liberalism,
built on liberty, built on fantasy, built on scorn for authority, etc.
Notice that section on authority. Notice of course, I think in principle
Americans are revolutionary, but then, let Americans understand the
need for authority and they are as, as... they are as respectful of
authority. For instance, in the American military, there always used
to be serious respect for the officers. The military operated by respect.
There used to be, and there still is, much respect for the office of
the President. And to this day...

Even Americans distinguish between the office and the carrier of the
office. But you find amongst quote unquote traditional Catholics, you
find many who don't make that distinction. The priest is either... if
you become a priest, you are either going to be, you've heard me say
many times, you're either going to be the greatest thing since sliced
bread or you're going to be the greatest traitor that ever was born
between from sea to shining sea. And it swings. It takes no more than
three minutes to swing from one to the other. One moment it's wonderful,
and the next moment, it's a back full of daggers. From one moment to
the next, simply because people are not making the right distinction.
They're not venerating the priest and just expecting the human being
to make mistakes. Instead of that, they either subsume the human being
into the priest and everything he does is absolutely wonderful, or they
pull the priesthood down to the level of the poor sinner, and then even
if he's a priest, he's a sinner. They can't make that distinction. And
it's materialistic thinking. It's thinking always materially and never
thinking formally. But of course, to think formally, you have to start
abstracting and nobody likes abstracting, so. But it's common sense.
It's common sense.

Notice then that passage on authority. And as Saint Peter argues, if
you behave yourselves well towards the authorities, you will gain the
respect and the confidence of men and you will silence your adversaries.
That's a payoff.

## Slavery and Modern Society

C18 to 25, the doctrine on slaves and masters or servants and masters.
We saw all of that yesterday. Did we get to the end of chapter two? Yes,
I think we did. Yes, we were into section D. On television, if any
television interviewer raises the subject of slavery, for him, it's an
axiom that slavery is the ultimate evil. But if a priest who's being
interviewed goes along with that, even a little bit, and says, "Oh, yes.
I know slavery is terrible," he's going to get into a wrong... He's
giving way to the wrong principles, and the interviewer is going to trip
him up. The interviewer will go logically from, "Oh, slavery is just
terrible." "Well, in that case, liberty is good." "Well, yes, I suppose
so." "In that case, religious liberty." "Well, yes, I suppose so." I mean,
it's from one thing to the next.

In other words, if somebody wants to talk to you about the evil of
slavery, fine, but slavery is not the ultimate evil. Sin is the ultimate
evil. Slavery is simply a human institution which gives quite big
opportunities to evil. Yes. It's an institution which is easily
exploitable because one man has power over another. It panders to the
desire of power and the wrong exercise of power. But from there to saying
that slavery is the ultimate evil, absolutely not.

If slavery is wisely operated, you've simply got what's going on today
all over the United States. People today are virtual slaves of their
punch clock, of their mortgage, of their paycheck, of whatever it is.
And you know, if people today think that they're in any real sense free,
they're slaves of their television, they're slaves of pornography,
they're slaves of the media, the newspapers. They take all of their
thinking. They're slaves without realizing it and they're treated like
slaves. These politicians scorn these people. These media men scorn
these people. They know what they can get away with. They despise the
people. They don't treat the people as free. They know that the people
are virtual slaves.

So, slavery is not the ultimate evil, but of course, it's part of the
great lie today, it's part of the great lie that we in the 20th century
are more wonderful and we are more free, we have more liberty, we are
more wonderful than any previous age has been. That's the great lie. So,
part of that lie is that people are not slaves today. They are. They
just don't know it. That's all. It's been cleverly disguised from them.
All right.

Who is the man that is truly free? The man who is master of himself with
the grace of God. Master of his passions, who controls himself. There
aren't many such men today. You've got to have a proportionate reason.
You've got to be careful of criticizing people in authority. You can
see the example I've quoted you many times, the example of our Lord
who is being gravely mistreated by Annas and Caiaphas but doesn't
disrespect them. Not a trace of disrespect towards the authority. And
Paul turns on the high priest, isn't it? Acts 22, around there. The high
priest who, again, is totally unjust to St. Paul, and St. Paul whips
around, "You whited sepulchre," or something. And he has some expression
for him. And then somebody said, "Do you realize you're talking to the
high priest?" "Oh," says St. Paul, "I didn't realize." It's in Deuteronomy,
"Thou shalt not, thou shalt not something the prince." Does anybody know
where that is? Look up Acts. Find the quotation in Acts. It's Acts 23:3.
Leviticus 19:15. That'll be it most likely. "Thou shalt not slander thy
neighbor." Leviticus 19:15 says, "Thou shalt not do thou which is unjust
or judge one way or another."

## The Nature of Men and Women Revisited

There's a French proverb, and it's absolutely true. Remember, if you're
at a Mass center, Cherchez la femme. Whenever you've got a problem in
a chapel, or a mission, or a Mass center, remember Cherchez la femme,
meaning there's bound to be a woman behind it. It's true. There's bound
to be a woman behind the problem. Just watch, I will see. The men don't
bother, usually, but the women, oh, la, la, la, la. So you have to look
after them. You look after them and then they're wonderful. If you don't
look after them, oof, there can be all kinds of trouble. They do need to
be looked after.

You've heard me say many times, the three Ls: listen, love, lead. Listen
to women. Do not argue with them. Do not argue with women. It is a
complete waste of time. Do not argue with women. It's unchivalrous for
a start. It's like boys... Never let boys play any sports with women,
with girls, because if the boys win it's unchivalrous, and if the boys
lose, it's unmanly. You... So it's a lose-lose situation. Don't...

In any school that you run, don't let the boys compete with the girls in
any way, shape, size or form, because if there's any danger of the boys
being beaten by the girls, all the self-respecting boys will just cut
out. They will cut out in order to demonstrate that they're not really
trying, because they couldn't really try and let themselves be defeated
by girls. It's not possible. It's against their manly pride, a correct
manly pride. It's not a false manly pride, it's a correct manly pride
when a man does not want to let himself be beaten by a woman. There's
nothing wrong with that. It's correct. The modern world teaches the
opposite. The modern world is crazy.

That doesn't mean to say that you build up the pride of the boys. You
can... When the boys are amongst the boys, you can humiliate them as
much as you like, but you don't humiliate them in front of the women,
because that's what... God entrusts authority to the boy, to the men.
The men have authority. The men are meant to have authority over the
women. They're meant to make the right use of that authority. They're
meant to have authority over the women, and therefore you don't... If
you make... If you humiliate the boys in front of the girls, you are
destroying the principle of authority. Exactly the opposite of what
Saint Paul's just been saying, or what Saint Peter's just been saying.

But in the Naval Academy, Dr. White will tell you, they now take... they
make the chief midshipman, they choose a midshipwoman to be the chief
midship- the chief midshippy. Midshipperson. You know, now, in the
liberal, in Liberville, when you go down the street, what you see on
the street are personholes, because you're not allowed, I'm sure, to
call it any longer a manhole, because you've got women workers who are
now street workers as well, so it could just as well be a womanhole as
a manhole, therefore it's got to be called a personhole, no doubt. The
modern world, it's stupid. Makes one gag for its stupidity.

## Practical Application: Listen, Love, Lead

So, listen, love. Listen, don't argue, but do listen. Listen to what
they have to say. Pay attention. Give them attention. They need attention.
Women need attention. And if you don't give it to them, they will get
their revenge. Women need attention. Give it to them and they will eat
out of your hand, especially if you love them. Listen to them, love
them. They will eat out of your hand if you give them attention and love.
They will be ready to do anything for you. And then lead. You listen to
everything they have to say and then you make the decision. The man makes
the decision. That's how it should be.

And there are all kinds of little things that you can let them decide.
In a home, broadly speaking, the woman is the queen of the home and he
is the king. The king is ad extra but the woman is ad intra. The home is
her domain, and if she wants this color of carpet and that color, let
her have it. Let her have it, let her have it, let her have it, because
she'll have it anyway. You know? But then when there's some major question,
then the man has got to put his foot down. "Darling, look, this is how
it's going to be. This is my responsibility and this is what I decided."
And if he's made up his mind, very easily, very often, she will simply
fall in line. She's made to follow her man. She's made to... She's made
adaptable. She's made to adapt. She's... Women are much more adaptable
than men are. They're quite different from men.

## The Importance of Family

You've heard me say this so often, but it's because the propaganda,
the false propaganda in the opposite direction is so current today. It's
everywhere. The nonsense is everywhere, and it's in order to destroy
the family, because if the revolution can destroy the family, then it
can make... It can do what it likes with the individuals. God designed
the individuals to be formed in the family, and they need a family to
build their souls just like they need calcium to build their bones.
Analogously generated. And if you can destroy the family, you will pull
human beings to pieces. It's as simple as that.

## The Nature of Men and Women

Never argue with a woman because they don't argue. They just grab the
nearest piece of mud and throw it at you. They don't argue because they
go by their hearts, they're not going by their heads. So the heart
doesn't get into any logic, but the heart grabs anything that will serve.
Some people say that women always fight dirty, and that's what they mean
by it. They don't fight according to the rules, they couldn't care two
pins about the rules. They know what they want, they know what they
need, and any argument is good that serves that purpose. So it's just a
pretense of arguing or thinking usually.

There's another proverb in French: Ce que femme veut, Dieu le veut. What
woman wants, God wants. And when she's speaking about her family, about
her husband, children, or family, there's a lot of truth in that. She
doesn't know often what she's saying or why. She knows things without
knowing why she knows them. It's called intuition. She's much stronger
in intuition than the man is. She intuits things. She knows they're true
by intuition, therefore she can't be bothered with the arguments. The
arguments are just a waste of time because she knows what she knows by
intuition, so the rest of it is a waste of time. The men can argue up
and down there as much as they like, but she knows what she knows.

And if it's, especially if it concerns her children, can you say she's
not always right about her children? Of course, because mothers can be
very blind about their children, but you've got to discern. There's a
time when they are right and that's when they're defending their young,
in the way the young should be defended. But then, of course, when
they're defending their young because the young are always right, that's
crazy, and that's the state we get into today.

## Differences and Complementarity

That's what God intended. God didn't make them to argue or to use
arguments. He didn't make them to think. He made the men to think. He
made the woman to feel. She's a creature of the heart. He's a creature
of the head. They're quite different and complementary. And that's why
a woman lawyer is an absurdity. If she comes into court, either she
looks pretty or she doesn't. If she doesn't look pretty, she's not
feminine. If she does look pretty, how can anyone in the court think
straight? So it's a lose-lose situation. It's a no-win situation.

But they insist upon getting into the law and then they insist upon
getting into all kinds of silly things that they've got no place, where
God never meant them to be. Obviously, He never meant them to be in the
military. He never meant them to be in law. He never meant them to be
in politics, with rare exceptions. But when you do get a woman who's
logical, she's liable to be much more terrible than any man who's
logical because she hasn't got the balance. She's made up her mind that
she... they don't think. It's a general rule, they don't think.

A woman who's logical is dangerous because she'll apply the logic
implacably, absolutely implacably. She's got in her head the one idea
that logic is a good thing. So, all right, she's going to... or the,
you know, masculinity is a good thing. Then she's going to make herself
masculine or she will drop hydrogen bombs on everybody in order to
prove that she's masculine. There's no sense of balance or reason. When
she tries to put masculine software into the computer, it just goes
bananas. Therefore, you must not admire women for being masculine. Do
not admire them when they're being masculine. Admire them and encourage
them when they're being feminine, not when they're fooling around or
provoking to fool around, but when they're doing what God meant them to
do, then admire them. A little male admiration goes a long way.

Also, a little affection goes a long way. These are things you're going
to need in the confessional. You need to know that a teaspoonful of
affection, they're good for another 200 miles. It's true. So, when they
do all the cooking or when they put together the potluck dinner, just
make sure that you say a few words of appreciation. It makes a lot of
difference. They need that a lot more than men need it. Men... there
are some men who need a bit of admiration, but women are built, they're
oriented towards men deeper than men are oriented towards women because
in scripture, "Your husband will have dominion over you." And so she's
dependent upon him in a way that he's not dependent upon, in a deeper
way than he is dependent upon her. Mark you, of course, a good wife is
an enormous strength to a husband and a deep strength. Scripture again
says that, "Who shall find a strong woman? She is more precious than..."
Proverbs 31. A good wife is an extraordinary, an enormous treasure, and
a bad wife is a martyrdom. So it goes deep both ways, but there is a
dependency on the side of the woman which there isn't on the side of
the man.

And therefore they keep coming back. They'll keep coming back towards
men. The feminists liberated themselves, quote unquote, from men, about
20 years ago, and then 10, 15 years later all the feminist magazines are
full of how, tricks how to get back towards the men because they can't
do without them. It's too deep. And therefore a man can be very cruel,
a husband can be very cruel to his wife if she keeps coming back to him
and he whips her or beats her with a stick. It's like a dog coming back
to its master and the master just beating the dog. Of course, I'm not
comparing wives to dogs. But that's why St. Paul says, "Husbands, love
your wives," and don't be harsh towards them. He says that about
children, but it applies to wives, too.

A woman, on the other hand, is very cruel to her husband if she doesn't
admire him. The husband needs to be admired or respected, looked up to.
His ego, male ego. The woman needs to be loved. That's the enormous and
crucial difference between men and women.

## The Problem of Modern Liberalism

And these things you need to know in the confessional because there are
many souls out there who are trying to run a marriage on the wrong
program. They're trying to run a Catholic marriage on a liberal program,
with a liberal idea of what a man should be and a liberal idea of what
a woman should be. You can't run a Catholic marriage on liberal ideas of
man and woman. You can't do it. So you've got to have an idea of Catholic
man and Catholic woman in order to guide these poor liberals back to
their places in which there's much more chance of a Catholic marriage
working, obviously, if they've got... You know, there are exceptions
to all rules. There are men who absolutely need the woman to wear the
trousers. And if you find such a man altogether with a woman who's
willing to wear the trousers, that's fine.

But today, broadly speaking, the women have... Many of the women who
are wearing the trousers don't basically want to do it, and they
shouldn't want to do it and many of them don't want to do it. All they
ask for is for their husbands to start wearing the trousers again. But
the liberal men have been persuaded that if they wear the trousers then
that's against equality, it's against feminine rights, it's against...
They got all kinds of silly ideas in their heads.

## Scripture on Marriage Roles

So you need to know what Scripture says about the family. What Scripture
says about man and woman is crucial because this is the word of God. So
He says to wives, "Be submissive to your husbands." Hey, that's not just
paternalism. It's not sexism. It's not colonialism. It's not fascism.
It's not antisemitism. It's the word of God. "Wives, be submissive to
your husbands." God says so. And it's not just St. Peter here, it's
obviously in the Epistles of St. Paul as well.

And then, "Husbands, look after your wives. Give honor. Behave chivalrously
to your wives as to the weaker vessel." Yes, they are weaker in physical
strength. They're far smarter in wiles. They're far stronger in smarts,
people smarts. Women are stronger. They can run around. Most of them can
run rings around their husbands when it comes to navigating. God made
it that way for a very good reason because if besides being weaker the
women were also dumber, the men would simply crush them. So they're
weaker, but smarter, at least people smarter. Not logic smarter, but
people smarter. That's a different thing.

And so they get their husbands sized up. They know their husband. They
can read their husbands like the palm of their hand, most of them. And
they can work around. They work around him. They work around what he
wants. And poor modern woman is having to work around modern man. I
blame modern man, principally, for the mess we got into today. Of course
woman bears her share of the blame, but she's basically a follower.
And I'm sure you've heard me say many times, if today she is wearing the
trousers, she's still following the men because it's the man who wants
her to wear the trousers because it's the man, liberal man, doesn't want
responsibility. He just wants to be... If she will look after herself,
the children are adults, the children will look after themselves, then I
don't have to bother. I don't have to behave like a father, etc., etc.
And that's the problem.

Father Doran can tell you the same thing. He has, from pastoral
experience in post-falls, he can tell you in many cases the problem,
the woman's problem, is the man's problem. The men are not men, and
that's the number one problem. If you straighten out the men, you got a
darn good chance of the women following afterwards. Not all of them, of
course. But many of them, all they want... And things can come straight.
There are so many things today to make things go crooked, but things can
come straight. There are a lot of young mothers, charming young mothers,
feminine young mothers in our missions and chapels. At least on Sundays
they don't wear trousers. And they come to the mission or the church or
whatever and they're looking after the children. I see it this time of
year with the confirmations, they go all over. They're looking after
the children. So it can come straight, and the good women, all they
want is to be given the right program to follow, and the right man to
follow, and the right man to look up to. That's all they want, the good
ones.

Of course, the other ones, well, they don't like the Catholic program.
They don't, because the Catholic program is humbling. Wearing a mantilla
over the head, it's important. It's not universal in the United States,
but it's better than in Europe, I think, in many countries in Europe.
And I'm darn sure that wearing dresses, at least on Sunday, is better
here in United States than it is in Europe. I'm told that many of the
women folk wear trousers even on Sunday in Europe, which is not good.
But that again, the women like to be... They think they want to be
emancipated or liberated, and of course, the emancipation of woman was
a great, quote unquote, "battle" from the beginning of this century.
You had the suffragettes, and then you had women wearing trousers, and
now you have the feminists. And basically, it's all, I'd venture to say,
it's a protest against these gutless men, these meaningless men. And so
the women have to try to take their place. And feminism is then, I say,
it's basically a protest. It's a great protest. It's not what the women
really want. It's not according to their nature, but they're protesting
against what the men are and what, or what the men aren't, rather.

Is there a connection between them and the temperance ladies? I don't
know about the temperance ladies. Was that the 1920s? 1910s? They wanted
to get the men out of the bars. Yeah. To get the men home. The wives
need a minimum of time, attention, and affection from their husbands.
They don't only need time, they also need attention. You've got to pay
attention to them. And not just attention, but some affection. So time,
attention, and affection. Some, and not more than some. A man can't
spend all his time hanging around his wife's neck. God forbid. And a
man's got to do what a man has to do. But the women do need the men at
home, and they do need the men to concern themselves with the education
of the children, and to back them in educating the children.

Some of the women today are heroic in the way they're trying to home-
school. Having the children that God sends and then trying to home-
school them. It's a big task. And if the men don't back them, if the
husband doesn't back them, then it's more than many of them can endure.
Whereas if the husband does back them, there's hardly a limit to what
they will do if their husband backs them and loves them and admires them
and gives them a hug and so on. Many of them, there's no limit to what
they will do, because she has sacrifice inscribed in her nature by God
in a way that man doesn't. And that's again, and always, because of
maternity, because of the children.

I was just over at the cottage on the other side of the road where
somebody is doing some painting. There's a bird just sitting on the roof
there because we were standing around. There's a nest with some little
ones built just by the door. She was sitting there watching. Normally
she'd fly away with people standing so close, but with her young so
close, she's standing there and watching. And I'm sure if you could
approach that nest and started fooling around, she would certainly have
kicked up a fuss. It's maternity is what's deepest in feminine nature
and it's what's noblest in feminine nature. That's what God made them
for. It's the prime purpose. They are the continuance of the human race,
a function in which man doesn't play nearly such an important part,
obviously.

So her place is the home. It's an old-fashioned saying. The Germans had
it. And of course, this is a saying which is horribly mocked today, but
it's absolutely true. Kinder, Küche, Kirche. Children, kitchen, church.
That's what the old-fashioned Germans said. But of course, again,
industrial suburbanism throws that all out, because if you want the
woman to stay at home and the home is isolated and the home is not
social and it's cut off from everybody else and it's boring, how do you
expect an adult to spend all their time with just screaming children?
She can't do it. Well, many of them can't do it, and it's not reasonable
to want them to do it. On the farm, they used to be isolated, yes, but
not the way it is today, not in the same context as today.

And that's why you get the soap operas. The soap operas which so many of
the women watch, it's the substitute village. It's the substitute human
interest. They're all interested in who's marrying who, who's going out
with who, who's on the brink of dying, who's arguing with who. It's all
human interest, which is what women are for. That's their specialty,
and they need that. And it's not fair to make fun of them always talking
to one another, because that's their business, to... They need to talk
to one another about husbands and about children, especially. And in the
old days, in the Victorian age, after a dinner, if the men and the women
went to dinner, after dinner, the men went into one room to talk about
politics, and the women went into another room to talk about the babies
and husbands.

Of course, today many women would resent that. They would say, "I want
to talk about politics." Well, she'll come in and talk about politics,
but she'll talk nonsense. She's not going to get a hold of the right
end of the stick very frequently, but she wants to be with the men. She
feels the need because she feels she's being shut out and scorned. Hell
hath no fury like a woman's scorn, you know? That's why you should look
after them and treat them with honor. He says that, giving honor to the
female, and that's the safest thing to do. Because if you don't give
them honor, watch out.

So, all right, they're strange creatures. Never think that you will
understand them. Never, never think that you will understand because you
won't. Husbands don't understand their wives. The longer they live with
them, the less they understand them. They don't run on the same gas. They
don't understand themselves because they're running on a program which
is deeper than they have any idea of. And basically that program is the
instinctive defense of the family, of children and family. And they
don't even understand themselves always why they do what they do or
think what they think. So let alone somebody else can understand. But
that's the way...

But how many a man will tell you, he's thought and thought and thought
about a problem, finally he sees what's right. His wife was saying it
three years ago, she saw it like that. She saw it just like that. She
said, "Why do you think that?" "I don't..." She can't say why she thinks
it, but she knows it. She sees it by intuition, then he gets there in
the end. So, you know. In any case, they're quite different.

## Exegesis of 1 Peter Chapter 3 (starting at verse 8)

All right, verses 8 to 12. "Let all practice fraternal charity." In
fine, which means in brief, in summary. "Be all of one mind, having
compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful,
modest, humble, not rendering evil for evil," and that's Romans 12,
"Nor railing for railing." To rail means, we would say sort of to yell,
to complain, to abuse, to yell at somebody. "Not rendering railing for
railing, but contrariwise blessing, for unto this are you called that you
may inherit a blessing." Well, that goes... "You have a heritage in
heaven," et cetera, et cetera.

"He that will love life," he quotes the Psalm, "will see good days. Let
him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile.
Let him decline from evil and do good. Let him seek after peace and
pursue it, because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and His ears
are unto their prayers, but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do
evil things." Obviously, that's the frowning face. "The frown of the
Lord is upon them that do evil things."

13 to 17. "Let nobody mind suffering for doing good." Once again, the
Christians are obviously beginning to suffer, so Saint Peter is
encouraging them in their tribulations. "Who is it that can hurt you if
you be zealous of good?" If you're enthusiastic to do good, who can hurt
you? "And even if you do suffer or get hurt for the sake of justice,
then you're blessed." "Blessed are you, again, when men shall persecute
you and lie against you and do all manner of things for my sake, for then
great is your reward in heaven." The end of the Sermon on the Mount.
Hear the same doctrine again. "If you suffer anything for justice' sake,
if you're suffering because of something right that you've done and it's
wrong that you're suffering, still you're blessed."

"Be not afraid of their fear and be not troubled." Be not afraid with
fear of them. Don't be afraid with the fear of worldly people or with the
worldly fear of people. It comes to the same thing. Be afraid of
offending God, but that's not their fear. They aren't afraid of that.
Be afraid... you should be afraid of offending God, but don't be afraid
with the kind of fear that they're afraid, by which they're afraid. Don't
fear their kind of fear. Fear a Christian's fear which is of falling
into sin and offending God. "Be not afraid with their fear, and be not
troubled." "Let not your heart be troubled." Our Lord, John 15. "I have
overcome the world. Be not troubled." "Take no thought for the morrow."
Sermon on the Mount. Don't be anxious. Don't worry. You could put a
smiley button in the margin at that point.

"But sanctify the Lord Jesus Christ in your hearts, being ready always
to satisfy everyone that asketh you a reason of the hope which is in you."
That's again an echo from before. "Sanctify the Lord Christ in your
hearts" is build the Lord Christ... In other words, build the life of
Christ in your hearts. Obviously, Christ is not made any more holy by
men, but the life of holiness, which is life in Christ, is increased in
the hearts of a man who is sanctifying himself. "Ready always to satisfy
everyone that asketh you a reason of the hope which is in you." That's
Colossians 4:6, "Let your speech be always in grace, seasoned with salt,
that you may know how you ought to answer every man." Always be ready
to defend your faith, in other words, to defend your way of life, your
faith, defend our Lord. "Being ready always to satisfy everyone that
asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you." You should always be
able to give an account of your faith to somebody who asks.

"But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience, that whereas they
speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good
behavior in Christ." In all of this, be modest and be with modesty and
fear, not their fear, which he's just told, he's just said we're not to
fear. That's verse 14. But with the fear of God, with modesty and the
fear of God. "Having a good conscience" in the state of grace. "That
whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse
your good behavior in Christ." In other words, give none of the
adversaries of Christ, give none of them an excuse to be adversaries of
Christ. On the contrary, give them every reason to respect whoever's
responsible for your good behavior. There's no real difficulty there.

Now it begins to get a little more difficult. "For it is better doing
well to suffer than doing ill." It is better doing well, if such be the
will of God, to suffer than doing ill. If you are sinning and then you
suff er, well then you're just getting what you deserve. If you're without
sin and you suffer because you're being persecuted unjustly, that's much
better than sinning. Socrates said, and it was already quite an advance
in his own time probably, "It's better to suffer an injustice than to
commit one." And that's argued I think in Plato's Gorgias. It seems like
a great conclusion coming from Socrates. Its current coinage in, it's
obvious in Christianity. So it's better to suffer for doing well than
for doing ill. You may think, "I don't mind suffering for doing ill
because then I deserve it, whereas suffering for doing well makes no
sense at all." On the contrary, said Peter. If you suffer for doing ill,
well that's you, you are getting what you deserve. But in the other case,
you're meriting. You're positively meriting. If such be the will of God,
it's not for us to positively go out and seek suffering. But if God
sends suffering our way, well then we have to accept it and work around
it.

## The Flood, Baptism, and Salvation (from 1 Peter)

Now, 18, it begins to get a little more difficult. "Because Christ also
died once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might offer us
to God being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the
spirit." That's not a problem. But then, "In which also coming, he
preached to those spirits that were in prison, which had been sometime
incredulous when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noah,
when the ark was a building wherein a few that is eight souls were saved
by water, whereunto baptism being of the like form now saveth you also."
That's a little rather more difficult.

18, "Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the
unjust." So there's the connection. Christ gave us an example of
suffering without, of, with suffering for doing well instead of for doing
ill. And the reason why He did this was to offer us to God being put to
death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit. Now this must,
in view of verse 19, refer to Christ's state between His death and His
resurrection. So being put to death in the flesh, and He's being
crucified, enlivened in the spirit is His soul descending live into
limbo. So His body is dead upon the cross, and then lying dead in the
tomb. His soul goes down alive to limbo.

"In which also coming, he preached to those spirits that were in prison"
19. Between His death and resurrection, He visited the spirits in limbo.
He visited the souls in limbo, preaching to those spirits that were in
prison. They were in limbo. They couldn't get out. They were caught,
trapped there, so to speak, in prison. He preached to those spirits means
He told them the good news that they were redeemed. The Protestants take
it to mean that we get a second chance even after death. The Church knows
that's not true. So that cannot be the meaning of verse 19. In view of
everything else the Church knows and teaches, it can't be that He's
preaching to the souls after death as though they still have a choice
to make. Therefore, preaching does not mean encouraging to repentance.
It means announcing the good news that they are redeemed. Because that's
why our Lord descended into limbo, in order to tell those souls that they
were redeemed...

"...which had been sometime incredulous when they waited for the patience
of God in the days of Noah, when the ark was a building." This is again
something that puts us back in the time of the Old Testament. Souls
which, for instance... He's not... obviously, our Lord... we're talking
about our Lord who went down to limbo. It's not only the souls that died
in the flood, the souls of those who died in the state of grace in the
flood. At the time of the flood, obviously, men were very wicked. They
had corrupted their ways. But the flood, obviously, it... it, well, it
stands to reason, the flood saved a large number of souls because when
people saw the waters coming up, they got down on their knees and
repented before they drowned. Not everybody for sure, but a large
number. Maybe not the majority, probably not the majority, but it's
still a large number.

So, which had been sometime incredulous, so an example, verse 20, an
example of the souls to whom our Lord preached in limbo... to whom our
Lord announced in limbo that they were redeemed is those souls that
mocked Noah before the flood. They were sometime incredulous, souls, for
instance, who made fun of Noah, of Noah we say... who made fun of Noah
before the flood, but died repentant in the flood. So, between death and
resurrection, our Lord went down to limbo to announce to the souls
waiting in limbo that they were redeemed, for instance, souls who had
disbelieved Noah when they waited for the patience of God in the days
of Noah.

When they waited for the patience of God, what does that mean? What's the
Latin? Quando expectaban patientiam Dei. What verse is it? Verse 20.
Quando expectaban Dei patientiam. I'm not sure, I didn't think about
that phrase... but it's probably when they were exploiting the patience
of God. Probably the meaning is that they were living off the patience
of God. They were waiting out, they were running out the patience of God.
The souls that didn't believe Noah, they were running out the patience
of God in the days of Noah when the ark was a-building. They disbelieved
right down to the end. Then it began to rain, and then it continued to
rain, and they rang the local radio station and so on, and they said,
"Well, we're sure it will stop in a little while."

"...when the ark was a-building wherein a few, that is eight souls, were
saved by water." He's referring... it's an interesting point. It's, um,
the flood... they died repentant in the flood from which eight souls
were saved by the ark. That, of course, is Mr. and Mrs. Noah, Mr. and
Mrs. Ham, Mr. and Mrs. Seth, and Mr. and Mrs. Japheth. That's all that's...
we know from this passage that the flood killed all human beings except
eight. It's an extraordinary thought, but that's where we know it from.
The only human souls that survived the flood. Traditions say that Mrs.
Noah was worse than a leaking roof. I don't know where tradition has
that from, but it's possible.

"...wherein a few, that is eight souls, were saved by water." Of course,
the problem here is that the water shifts signification. If you take the
ark as the church, and then baptism, and then sin, the sin is the flood,
whereas the baptism is what saves, entry into the ark. So the ladder,
you could say. The ladder that led up into the ark is like baptism
leading into the Church. And as the Church saves from sin, so the ark
saved from the flood. St. Peter... the problem is that the water is here
and then it's there. So Peter's thought is jumping from the water of
the flood, in which only a few were saved by the ark, to the water of
baptism, by which only a few are saved from sin. Only by the ark were
they saved from the flood, only by baptism are they saved... only by
the ark were they saved from water, only by water are they saved from
sin. The confusion is there. He says, "In which also... wherein a few,
that is eight souls, were saved by water whereunto baptism..." See the
water shifts meaning. In one case, the water is deadly. In the other
case, the water is salvation. In the case of Noah, the water is death.
In the case of baptism, the water is salvation. So the water shifts. And
yet the water is the swing point, the pivot of this comparison. So the
pivot gets dislocated.

Is it a case of the water's grace? Well, yes. The sin, the flood wipes
out sinners, yes. But you know, a baptism doesn't wipe out the sinner.
But it wipes out sin? Yeah, of course baptism wipes out sin, yes. But
it's not the same. It's really not... The water doesn't have the same
signification in both cases. At the Red Sea, the water wiped out the
Egyptians. And the Egyptians stand for world and sin. Therefore, there,
the water is salvation. The Red Sea, the water is salvation. But in the
flood, the water was the instrument of God to kill sinners.

Did Ron say, maybe especially, He killed all men, He killed sinners
whether they were born into sin or not born into sin? Uh, it's... Water
drowns the sinner in that sense. If you want to think of it that way,
yes. In any case, what he says though... it's rather like Paul. The
thoughts sort of tumble out. It's all there, but it's not laid out like
an article of St. Thomas, let's just say. I'm not saying that there's
anything inaccurate obviously, this is the word of God, but it's not laid
out with care and accuracy in order not to confuse. It's just under
inspiration and it needs some sorting out.

So when the... In the flood, a few, eight souls, were saved by water
and the suggestion is that it's only a few that are saved by baptism.
It's not a statement, but it's a suggestion that, in other words, you
Christians should not be surprised if you're a small number surrounded
by a... And that must have been one of the first problems of... It's
always a problem of traditionalists today. Why are traditionalists so
few in number? It's regularly a problem with Catholics. Why are there
so few? "Well," says St. Peter, "It's because there were only eight
souls saved in the flood." So if it's only eight souls being saved by
baptism now, don't be surprised. It's mysterious, but it shouldn't be
surprising.

"A few, that is eight souls, were saved by water whereunto..." So the,
um, flood is comparable to the dangers of the world from which Christian
souls are saved by the sacrament of baptism. The flood is comparable to
the dangers of the world, the sin, sin in the world... from which souls
are saved by baptism, or from which Christians' souls are saved by the
sacrament of baptism. And that sacrament is not an Old Testament
ablution. "Whereunto baptism being of the like form now saveth you
also." Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh. In other words,
it's not just an Old Testament ablution. Compare Hebrews 9. It's not just
an Old Testament ablution, which could only wash away the sins of the
flesh. The contaminations. Like, for instance, having touched a corpse
that caused a physical contamination, which a Jew had to go through
certain ablutions to cleanse. But St. Paul says those ablutions were
powerless to touch the soul. Whereas the New Testament sacraments have
power to cleanse and affect the soul. Ex opera operato.

So, "A few, that is eight souls, were saved by water. When the ark was
fully, wherein a few, that is eight souls, were saved by water." I can't
think of just why it's separated from everything else. Yes. The souls
were saved, the eight souls were saved by water. It's a strange... It
doesn't make sense, you know. Obviously, it's a strange expression. He's
talking about Romans Chapter 6, where he talks about how we're baptized
into death. That's the reason, the power of baptism to cleanse souls comes
from the passion of Christ. We're baptized in His death. But that's not
the Old Testament. That's not Noah. Well, yeah, but I'm asking about...
Well, yes, but the death is only submersion in a figurative sense.

Is that due to the corruption of the world that the flood had not
destroyed...? Yes. They might... Yeah. Yes, I see what you're saying.
Yes. If Noah and his family had to go on, go on living in the world like
Lot in Sodom, if Lot had been forced to go on living in Sodom, they were
saved in that sense. Maybe that's what he means, yes. In that case, the
flood, as you say, separates from them. In that case... How can one put
it? It needs reorganizing. The obvious thing is that the water killed
a lot of people.

In any case, it's certain that for Peter, the water, um, answered in,
in... What verse is that? Chapter three, verse 20, yes. Through the
water in which they were saved. Eight souls were saved through the water.
I suppose you could say, yes, they were saved from the world, they were
saved from corruption by the flood. In that, that certainly makes it
easier to understand that way, yes. Yeah. They were saved from the
corruption. They were saved from the world, in which case... Then, then,
then you'd say, this is the world to me. They were saved from, uh, the
eight souls were saved by the ark through water, the flood. They're
saved in the ark by the flood from the world. Well, they obviously are
there saved by the ark from the flood, but in the ark, eight souls in
the ark by the flood from the world. Christians are saved in the church
by baptism, from sin, from, from the world. Yeah, that's easier,
certainly. That makes it... That's more reasonable.

All right. Then, 21, "...baptism being of the like form now saveth you
also." So baptism, the water of baptism saves a small minority now,
just like the water of the flood saved thanks to the ark, a few souls.
So baptism, the water of baptism saves a few souls. But baptism is not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh. It's not just the material
ablution of the Old Testament. It's "the examination of a good conscience
towards God at the resurrection of Jesus Christ." Baptism is a spiritual
sacrament. It acts upon the soul.

And lastly, who is on the right hand... "The resurrection of Jesus Christ,
who is on the right hand of God swallowing down death that we might be
made heirs of life everlasting being gone into heaven, that we might be
made heirs of life everlasting." Colon. He, Christ, being gone into heaven,
"the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him." So the
first half of the verse... well, the verse basically refers to Christ,
but there's a final clause in the middle that refers to we men, "that
we might be made heirs of life everlasting," and then it refers back to
Christ being gone into heaven, "the angels and powers and virtues being
made subject to him." So the power of baptism comes from... It's a
spirit, it's a spiritual baptism with its power coming from Christ who
is at the right hand of God to intercede for His system, Paul in Hebrews.
Who's at the right hand of God to enable us to go to heaven, says Saint
Peter, same thing. He having gone into heaven and the angels and powers
and virtues being made subject to him. We'll pick up again in 10 or 11
days time.
