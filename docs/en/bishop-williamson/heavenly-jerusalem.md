Bishop Williamson deciphers the mystical imagery of the Heavenly Jerusalem,
discusses Wordsworth and romanticism, and critiques doctrinal extremes like Feeneyism.

# Heavenly Jerusalem, Romanticism and Feeneyism

Bishop Williamson explains that various stones hold significance: onyx represents
humility, sardius, martyrdom and patience, and chrysolite, brilliant apostolic
activity. He says beryl signifies the works of mercy, topaz the contemplative life,
and chrysoprasus the desire for Heaven. Jacinth, he continues, symbolizes the
charity of contemplation, and amethyst, the virtue of modesty. 

Bishop Williamson discusses Wordsworth's poetry, noting that romanticism can lead towards God or away
from Him. He explains that in the Heavenly Jerusalem, the twelve gates are twelve
pearls, representing the Apostles, and the street is pure gold, signifying the elect's
charity and integrity. There is no temple, for God and the Lamb are its temple,
and no sun or moon, as God's glory illuminates it. Bishop Williamson states that
the river of life is divine grace. 

He then critiques Feeneyism, saying it is an exaggeration of 'extra ecclesiam nulla salus' 
and a departure from Catholic teaching. He affirms that Archbishop Lefebvre, unlike Father Feeney, 
never slipped up in doctrine and warns that such exaggeration can lead back to errors like
liberalism.

## The Symbolism of Precious Stones in the Heavenly Jerusalem

Various stones hold significance. Onyx represents humility.
Sardius, colored blood red, signifies martyrdom and patience. *Patior, patis,
passus sum* – knowing how to suffer, *patientia*. Chrysolite, sparkling yellow,
denotes brilliant apostolic activity. Beryl is a warm pale green, representing the
works of mercy. You certainly don't have to learn all this, obviously, but it's
interesting.

Then topaz is a brilliant gold, the most sparkling of all, signifying the
contemplative life. Chrysoprasus – it's Greek, obviously, *chruso* is gold.
*Chrusos*; Chrysostom was "golden mouth." Saint John Chrysostom was the golden mouth,
patron of preachers. Chrysoprasus is a green-gold color, representing the desire
for Heaven. Topaz signifies the contemplative life because when caught in the
sunlight, it out-dazzles all the other stones. Chrysoprasus, green-gold color,
the desire of Heaven: the ardent desire for eternal life which follows
contemplation. The desire to be dissolved in order to be with Christ, Philippians
1:23.

Jacinth, the eleventh stone, is red-gold colored, signifying the charity of
contemplation. Finally, amethyst is colored violet, like a flower hidden and
perfumed, representing the virtue of modesty.

## Wordsworth's Lucy Poems and the Nature of Romanticism

"She dwelt amidst untrodden ways, beside the springs of Dove. A maid whom there
were none to praise, and very few to love. Like violet 'neath a mossy stone,
half-hidden from the eye. Or like a star when only one is shining in the sky.
She dwelt unknown and few could know when Lucy ceased to be. But now she's in her
grave and, oh, what a difference to me."

"A slumber did my spirit seal. I had no human fears. She seemed a thing that could
not feel the touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force. She neither
hears nor sees. Rolled round in Earth's diurnal course with rocks and stones and
trees." Anybody know the poet? Wordsworth. Wordsworth is right, yes. Those are two
of the Lucy Poems. Lucy was some lass that Wordsworth must have known. I don't know
the full story about Wordsworth, but he was one of the English romantic poets.
Lucy was a lass he must have gotten to know up in the Lake District. The Lake
District is a very beautiful corner of England, up in the northwest, just beneath
the Scottish border. It's full of tourists at the wrong time of year, but at that
time, it was fairly empty. Coleridge also was up there writing poetry.

"Like violet 'neath a mossy stone half-hidden from the eye, or like a star when
only one is shining in the sky. She dwelt unknown and few could know when Lucy
ceased to be. But now she's in the grave and, oh, the difference to me."
"Rolled round in earth's diurnal course." What does that mean, "diurnal course,"
Lester? And what happened to her? "A slumber did my spirit seal. I had no human
fears. She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years." It's the
last of the Lucy poems. "No motion has she now, no force. She neither hears nor
sees. Rolled round in earth's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees."
Circular. She's going back to dust. Not quite. She is doing that, but… a diet for
worms, as Hamlet says. She's feeding the worms. "Why nothing but to show that a
king may go a process through the guts of a beggar."

Diurnal. Anybody? D-I-U-R-N-A-L. Well, we usually call an owl a nocturnal owl. So
diurnal is the opposite of nocturnal. I've got an office which is called a diurnal
because it's from Lauds to Compline, without Matins. Matins is during the night;
all the other hours are during the day, so it's called a diurnal. "Rolled round in
earth's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees." What do you think that
means then? He's not strictly right, but… "Rolled round in earth's diurnal
course." Surely. "No motion has she now, no force. She neither hears nor sees.
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course." So she's six feet under, not only pushing
up daisies but also spinning with the rotation of the earth once a day. "Rolled
round in earth's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees." That's William
Wordsworth, W-O-R-D-S-W-O-R-T-H. He was born in 1770 and died in 1850. Just before
the French Revolution, he went over to France and was all excited about the
revolution. He really believed in it. "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but
to be young was very heaven." But then he wised up. As he grew up, he realized
that the French Revolution wasn't such a good thing. His later poetry is nothing
like as famous as his earlier poetry. I don't think practically anybody reads what
he wrote later. He became a very sort of respectable and stodgy gentleman.

He had a disciple who became a very famous Catholic priest. Anybody? A convert who
became a famous Catholic priest. Very famous. So famous none of you know him.
About that time. Jenkins? Faber. Father Faber. Father Faber began life as a poet.
That's what Charles Coulombe calls the two sides of romanticism. Romanticism has
an upside and a downside. The upside is that it's reopening towards something more
than just reason; it's opening up to something transcendent. The downside of
romanticism is that while there's an opening for God, and so the disciple of the
romantic poet goes all the way and becomes a Catholic priest, the downside is also
just feelings and selfishness – "my self, my feelings." And the descendant of
romanticism in that sense is rock and roll. So romanticism is a two-edged sword.
It can go towards God, or it can go away from God. Both things. It's ambiguous.

## The Heavenly Jerusalem: Revelation Chapter 21

Alright. The last stone is amethyst, colored violet, which stands for modesty.
"Like violet 'neath a mossy stone, half-hidden from the eye." Typically, violets
are small and hidden, and they have a beautiful perfume. There are not many
flowers that have a perfume. Roses, obviously. Violets. What others? Lavender,
which is not really a flower. Carnation? Does a carnation have a scent? Lilacs?
Yes, lilacs do. Not many.

Then, verse 21: "And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one to each, and every
several gate was of one several pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold,
as it were, transparent glass."

### Gates of Pearl and the Apostles

The twelve gates are twelve pearls. We've seen the twelve gates as the twelve
Apostles. Jenkins, can you check on this? Is it the same twelve stones? It is.
And where do you find the list of the twelve stones? In Exodus? 39? I don't know.
Exodus. What's it called? The Urim and the Thummim. What was the pectoral thing on
the High Priest? The Pectoralis? No, it's not called a pectoral. There's another
name for it. Rational? Rational, maybe, yes. That's right. Exodus, you say 39:10?
Because it's not quite the same. Carbuncle? Ligurious? Agate? It doesn't look as
if it's quite the same. I don't know. Dom Guéranger doesn't mention the twelve
stones of the rational. What Pope wore a rational? Benedict XVI, yes. The man was mad.

So all twelve apostles had all of these twelve virtues, but each of them had one
in particular. Every several gate, each of the several gates was of one several
pearl, had one particular of the many pearls. For instance, which apostle was
faith? Peter, yes. Peter's faith, and so on. So the twelve gates were of all stones;
all the stones were in all the gates, but each gate had one particular pearl. Each
apostle had one particular virtue.

### The Street of Pure Gold

The street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. We've really
already seen that. The street is the mass of the elect, full of charity and of
transparent integrity. You saw that above. He said, "Shining with the love of God,"
last time. Shining clearly with the love of God here, integrity.

The sapphires import, because he was wrapped up to the third heaven. Chalcedony is
Saint Andrew because of his passion. Emerald, virginity, Saint John. Onyx,
humility, Saint Philip. Sardius, Saint James, the first martyr, patience.
Chrysolite, apostolic activity, Bartholomew, because of his eloquence. Beryl, works
of mercy, Saint Thomas. Topaz, Saint Matthew, the contemplative life. Chrysoprasus,
desire of heavens, Saint Jude. Hyacinth, Saint Simon, charity of contemplation.
Amethyst, Saint Matthias.

The place of the city, the street of the city, is the mass of the lesser saints
and the less elect. They are gold because of their charity and like transparent
glass because there's no more self-love or duplicity. No more guile or self-love,
selfishness or guile.

### No Temple in Heaven

Verse 22: "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty is the temple
thereof, and the Lamb." No temple. All heaven bathes its inhabitants in the real
presence of God, in the beatific vision. You don't have a church and then places
that aren't church. Everywhere is like church with the real presence and the
vision of God. There's no distinction in heaven between secular and profane. You
don't have to keep any swing doors shut. All heaven bathes its inhabitants in the
real presence of God and in the beatific vision. "I saw no temple therein,"
because it's all a temple. "For the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof, and
the Lamb." Also, in the vision of Christ's sacred humanity, which is the supreme
temple. The whole of heaven is a temple, but of course, the supreme temple of God
is the humanity in which Christ especially indwells by hypostatic union. John
2:19-21: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." Verse 19
and verse 21 refer to the temple of His body. "The Lord God Almighty is the temple
thereof, and the Lamb." The whole of heaven is God's dwelling place, and
particularly the humanity of Christ.

### The Light of God's Glory

Verse 23: "And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it.
For the glory of God hath enlightened it: and the Lamb is the lamp thereof." The
city has no need of the sun. The sun is knowledge from reason, which is often
clouded and half benighted, often hidden by clouds and half of the time hidden by
night. It's knowledge from reason, which is a fairly defective, insufficient, and
limited knowledge. "For the glory of God hath enlightened it, and the Lamb is the
lamp thereof." In heaven, God will illuminate intelligences directly. Prima Pars,
Question 89. What's it called in Latin? The Lumen Gloriae. The Light of Glory.

Is the human intellect natural or supernatural? The human intellect belongs to our
nature; it's therefore natural. If you put the beatific vision directly into a human
intellect, what happens? All the fuses blow. The poor little human intellect simply
can't take it. The overflow of light, the voltage is so high that the fuses simply
blow. So, you need to plug an adapter into the human intellect, which will then be
able to take the beatific vision. And that adapter is the Lumen Gloriae. The Lumen
Gloriae then enables you to take the beatific vision because the beatific vision is
a vision of God Himself. But there has to be something between the human intellect
and God Himself for the human intellect to be able to see God, and that is the
Lumen Gloriae, the Light of Glory. So God Himself will be the light of the
intellect. "The glory of God hath enlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof."
And the brilliant Christ will eclipse the sun, even if it were seven times
brighter. Isaiah 30:26. Find that quotation. "And the light of the moon shall be
as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
of seven days, in the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his people, and
shall heal the stroke of their wound." So, Christ will eclipse the sun, being even
seven times brighter. Isaiah 30:26. The brilliance of Christ's risen humanity in
heaven.

### Nations Walking in Light, Gates Perpetually Open

Verse 24: "And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the
earth shall bring their glory and honour into it." After the darkness of faith,
Catholics now walk as in the day. After the nighttime of faith... "Now I see as in
a puzzle," as 1 Corinthians 13 says. "Now I see as in a dark glass, but then..."
"For now we see through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know
in part; but then I shall know even as I am known." That's Paul describing the
darkness of faith. Faith is imperfect. Faith and hope in this life carry an
intrinsic imperfection, whereas charity has no imperfection, even in this life.
But faith has an intrinsic imperfection, which is why faith and hope will be done
away with in heaven, but charity will continue.

Therefore, here you have the nations shall walk in the light of it, in the light
of the humanity of Christ. After walking in the relative darkness of faith in this
life, Catholics will be walking in heaven as in daylight, in the daylight of
Christ's humanity. "The kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into
it." The kings are the church leaders who will seek and procure only the glory of
God. They will no longer be looking for their own glory from everything they've
done for the church. They will only be looking for the glory of the heavenly city.
So the peoples, the masses, will be walking as in daylight, and the leaders will
be seeking only the glory of God.

Verse 25: "And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no
night there." In heaven, there's no need to shut gates. What do you think that
means? Portugal? Against whom? Against heretics, thieves, freethinkers. The Church
is defending primarily against heretics. And where do you see in the Church this
idea of shutting out, an idea lost with Vatican II? The true Church definitely has
an idea of shutting out. Anybody? The porters. Yes, you see it there. They're
bouncers. If you read the Latin, it calls them bouncers. They really bounce out of
the church all those who don't belong there. It's true. Read the Latin.
Then where else? Peter's keys. The keys of Peter to lock the door: "What you bind
will be bound, what you loose will be loosened." "You will shut and nobody will
open, you will open and nobody will shut." Where is that? That's in the Advent
antiphons, isn't it? O Clavis, surely. And where is that from? Does anybody
remember? Is it Isaiah? I can't remember the original quotation on which that
antiphon is based. All antiphons are soaked in scripture. Isaiah 22:22. "And I
will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and
none shall shut: and he shall shut, and none shall open." Exactly, Isaiah 22:22.
Well done. That's it, on which that Advent antiphon is built.

Here in heaven, there's no need for that. So, there are no thieves, heretics, or
freethinkers. They're all in hell. There's no night even. There'll be no sleeping,
no alarm clocks, no thirteen pings. It's gone up. Who put it up one or two? Used to
be at twelve, then I think eleven, and now it's thirteen. Who else counts them?
Does somebody count them every morning? No night. The humanity of Christ is a
steady flood of light, 24 hours a day. That was a punishment at Waco; they kept
blazing lights on them right through the night. And then also, anybody? It's a
punishment only the 20th century could dream of. What else did they do to the poor
people in Waco? Finally, of course, they burnt and shot and killed them. It sounds
appalling. But before then, Hoffman? They played rock music right through the
night. Poor devils must have gone crazy. Blasting rock music and blazing light.
That's not exactly heaven. But here in heaven, the 24-hours-a-day light is, of
course, glory rather than suffering, obviously. "There will be no night there."

Verse 26: "And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it." The
glory and honor of the nations is the elect, virtuous, and upright. "For our glory
is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity
of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in
this world: and more abundantly towards you." The elect, virtuous, and upright.
The glory and honor of any nation, if you stop and think about it, is its
Catholics. Especially its consecrated souls in any nation.

Verse 27: "There shall not enter into it any thing defiled, or that worketh
abomination or maketh a lie, but they that are written in the book of life of the
Lamb." The defiled is sins of the heart. There will be no sins of the heart. "Or
that worketh abomination": sins of action. "Lie": sins of word. All of these will
be inexorably barred entry. All sin of thought, deed, or word will be ruthlessly
excluded. Any questions on chapter 21? A very beautiful vision of heaven, a
description of heaven.

## The River and Tree of Life: Revelation Chapter 22

Chapter 22. The Heavenly Jerusalem. The first part was the glorification of the
saints, the splendors of the heavenly city. Now, the twelve fruits. This runs from
verse one until verse five. Verses six to the end are an epilogue. In chapter 21,
the split was at verses eight and nine; from verse nine to verse 27, which we just
had.

Chapter 22: "And he shewed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street
thereof, and on both sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve
fruits, yielding its fruits every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations. And there shall be no curse any more: but the throne of
God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him. And they
shall see his face: and his name shall be on their foreheads. And night shall be no
more: and they shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun,
because the Lord God shall enlighten them. And they shall reign for ever and ever."

He showed me a river. The river is divine grace, peace, joy, life, love, coming
out of God. That is to say, the Holy Ghost proceeding from the throne of God and
of the Lamb, the Father and the Son. So the river is like the Holy Ghost, divine
grace appropriated to the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son.
Clear as crystal, both firm and transparently pure like crystal.

## Critique of Feeneyism: The Dangers of Doctrinal Exaggeration

In the Church Militant, the river is the waters of baptism, and it flows only
inside the city because *extra ecclesiam nulla salus*. The Feeneyites think we
don't believe that. It's foolish. Of course, we believe it. Only we don't
exaggerate by denying any baptism other than that of water. It's fatal to
exaggerate. Father Feeney was a magnificent anti-liberal; he really was very fine.
But he exposed himself; he invited Rome to destroy him by exaggerating on doctrine,
and that just gave Rome all they needed to destroy him. The liberals in Rome… It
may well have been the liberals that were behind the condemnation, but the
condemnation itself is simply Catholic doctrine. It says that you can't say
there's no baptism of desire or blood. It's just not what the Church has always
taught. The Church has never defined baptism of desire or blood as a dogma of
faith, but it's certainly always taught it. The Feeneyites are silly to say the
Church hasn't taught it, or that Church Doctors haven't taught it. Of course,
they've taught it. It's silly, but they are obsessed with finding a strong way of
smashing liberals.

But it's foolish; it's materialistic. They grab hold of: either there's water and
there's baptism, or there's no water and there's no baptism. It's simple, it's
clear, and it's dumb. A lot of things that are simple and clear are dumb. Doctrines,
you can't exaggerate. And Father Feeney, by exaggerating like that, gave Rome all
they needed to destroy him, even if it was the liberals in Rome that were behind
the condemnation. But the condemnation is actually Catholic doctrine. It's a shame
because he was right in so many ways.

Jenkins? If he never did come, then I'm not too sure about it. I mean, I suppose
you could say he came because of *The From the Housetops* articles, right? By
reading between the lines. Well, don't trust what you read in *The From the
Housetops*. They're saying that he didn't show up for that one. Well, that may be,
but in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, you've got the text of his condemnation, which is
doctrinal. And it's not just because he didn't show up; it's because he made an
error of doctrine. He was in error in doctrine. You can't do that.

The great advantage of Archbishop Lefebvre was that he never slipped up in
doctrine. You can listen now at lunchtime; they're trying to trip him up. They
tried to trip him up. They went through all his works with a fine-tooth comb.
Suddenly, Rome dug out all their old manuals of theology, which, of course, they'd
all thrown away because of Vatican II. But suddenly, to condemn the Archbishop,
they dug them all out. They went through them with a fine-tooth comb, and suddenly
they all remembered their theology for the purpose of condemning the Archbishop,
just for a few moments. But they couldn't find anything. He knew his theology, and
he never departed from theology. That was his great strength. And it was Father
Feeney's fatal weakness to depart from Catholic teaching.

The result is now that the Feeneyites are making a nuisance of themselves in many
of our chapels and churches. They're a darn nuisance. Because *sub specie boni*,
under the appearance of good, under the appearance of being strong anti-liberals,
here they come and say, "Outside the Church, there's no salvation! And the Society
of Saint Pius X, you don't believe it, we do! We are Catholics, and you're
liberals!" I mean, come on. But it looks simple. It's simple, you know? No water,
no baptism; no Church, no salvation. It's materialistic. It's making the boundary
between the Church and the non-church purely materialistic: water. Yes, our Lord
attached salvation to water, yes, He did, but not exclusively so that He never
allowed Himself an exception. That's foolishness. It's common sense that there
could be exceptions in the normal run of life. God is not tied to His own
sacraments. Well, He is tied to them, but not in such a way that He cannot allow
Himself any exceptions. That's foolishness.

But the Feeneyites are foolish, and they're a nuisance because they seem to have
very Catholic principles, and they're "more Catholic than the Catholics." That's
the typical story of exaggerating in the opposite direction. If you can't get
somebody, you knock him over once, you knock him over again, he comes back up. You
knock him over a third time; well, now he's getting wise, so he leans over so that
when the devil comes, he won't go. What does the devil do? He goes around the back,
boom. It's dead easy. So, people that are so strong against the liberals, you just
come around the back and make them exaggerate in anti-liberalism, and they fall
into the opposite error.

Funnily enough, opposite errors have a way of rejoining themselves, which is why
the Feeneyites team up again with liberals. Anybody? What kind of liberals are
Feeneyites liable to team up with? Masons. Yes. Who are? More obviously, if they're
not Masons, most of them are, at least... Americanists. And Americanism is, of
course, liberalism again. And so these Feeneyites, who were so strong against
liberalism, are back into Americanism. Those errors meet up. If you push too far
away from one error, you'll come back to it through the back door. It's funny, but
that's how it is; it's how it happens.

So the truth is a balance. The truth is not discovered by dividing the distance
between two errors and affecting exactly the halfway point. The truth is not
"middlest," so to speak. But the truth is often in the middle of two errors: an
error of excess and an error of defect. You don't find the truth by measuring off
between the excess and the defect. But there will often be, just like against
obedience, most people sin by disobedience. That's a defect of obedience. The
excess is false obedience or exaggerated obedience. And sure enough, with
exaggerated obedience – "the Pope, the Pope, the Pope" – you fall into
disobedience. You disobey the whole Catholic Church by following modernism in the
name of exaggerated obedience. Exaggerated obedience and disobedience join hands
again because they're both from the devil. 

So the devil gets you, as the old song says, "If the left hand doesn't get you..." 
Schmid, could you sing it for us? "If the left hand doesn't get you, then the right 
hand will." Right? Or the opposite. "If the right hand doesn't get you, then the left 
hand will." Yes. Okay. What song is that from? "Sixteen Tons," "I owe my soul to 
the company store."
