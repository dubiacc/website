Bishop Williamson dissects the Thomistic principle 'Forma sequitur inclinatio' to 
explain the natural and supernatural, and to critique modern theological deviations 
that blur the distinction between grace and nature.

# Forma Sequitur Inclinatio: Thomistic Principles Against Modern Errors

Bishop Williamson explains the Thomistic principle 'Omnem forma sequitur inclinatio,' 
asserting that every form has a corresponding inclination which cannot exceed the 
form itself. He distinguishes between natural and supernatural information of the 
intellect, arguing that a purely natural intellect cannot possess an instinctive 
desire for the supernatural vision of God; such a desire, he states, must be elicit 
and inefficacious, prompted by supernatural revelation. 

Bishop Williamson critiques modernism for blurring the crucial distinction between 
grace and nature, exemplified by what he terms 'granatus'—a supposed inherent blend 
of grace and nature in man, which he attributes to figures like John Paul II. He 
stresses the primacy of dogma, asserting it is the foundation for moral theology 
and that the world's current ills stem from heresy and a rejection of truth.

## Commentary on Revelation and Introduction to a Core Principle

Chapter 16, The Seven Vials/Cups. The third vial, verse four, we had seen. 
The doctors of the third or fourth century poured out their vials
upon the rivers, which are the rivers of heretics, flowing downhill to hell. The
fountainheads of the rivers are the heresiarchs. And there was blood, as their
bloody punishment of heretics. You heard that again with the evening reading,
Arnold of Brescia. Peter Abelard spins theories in the theology hall, and it
comes out on the streets soon after that. Theology works on the streets, you
better believe it. Vatican II is going to work out as our chastisement. It's
going to work out on the streets of the universal world.

But Vatican II, that question of the vision of God, question 12, do we have a
natural vision of God? I was talking about it with Father Godfrey. But there's a
ginormous principle behind that. That is this: *Omnem forma sequitur inclinatio*.
To form corresponds inclination. It's a ginormous question.

## The Principle: Omnem Forma Sequitur Inclinatio

Form is either *cognoscens* (knowing) or *incognoscens* (not knowing).
*Incognoscens* is, of course, *intellectiva* (intellective) and *sensitiva*
(sensitive). You could say *incognoscens seu entitativa* (entitative).
Let's say that the form of my being... For instance, if I get thrown out of the
window on the 10th floor, I may be a rational being, but I crash to the ground
exactly like a camera, exactly like a stone. It's my *forma entitativa* which
crashes to the ground. If my *forma sensitiva* or *intellectiva* had anything to
do with it, I wouldn't be crashing to the ground. So, my *forma sensitiva*, at
that point, is anticipating a nasty collision and therefore is screaming. And my
*forma intellectiva* is screaming rationally because, with my reason as well, I
know that I'm going to hit the ground.

So, to that triple form corresponds a triple inclination. This is *appetitus*
(appetite). It's either the sensitive appetite (passions) or the intellective
appetite, which is *voluntas* (will). Whereas the entitative is not an appetite,
except in the broad sense. This is an *inclinatio entitativa*, like the stone
falling to the ground. So, for instance, *lapis cadit* (the stone falls). That's
its inclination if it's left without support. *Ovis fugit* (the sheep flees).
The sheep sees the shape of a wolf on the horizon and scrams. And then, of
course, the intellective, *voluntas*, will be something I grasp in my mind and
which I desire with my will. For example, "Opera, let's go!" *Opera eas, vamos*.

### Form as Information

St. Thomas will say, "Upon every form there follows an inclination."
*Inclinatio sequitur omnem formam*. An inclination follows every form. He could
just as well say, "*Omnis inclinatio sequitur quandam formam*." Every inclination
follows upon some form. There's an absolute correlation between form and
inclination. This cognitive form is also *informatio* (information). I am
informed entitatively by human nature. I am informed cognitively by what I'm
sensing and by what I'm intelligizing. What I'm sensing is a classroom, and that
informs me. What I'm intelligizing is the same classroom, but intelligibly. The
intellect is abstracting the intelligible essence of a classroom.
Therefore, this is my form and that's my information. The profundity of St.
Thomas and Aristotle is to see the analogy between the entitative information
and the cognitive information. In any case, each has its corresponding
inclination.

## Natural vs. Supernatural Information and Inclination

Now, let's subdivide the *informatio intellectiva* into *naturalis* (natural)
and *supernaturalis* (supernatural). There's a natural information of my
intelligence and a supernatural information of my intelligence. The supernatural
information of my intelligence, for instance, by the faith, is seated in the
intellect. It is a supernatural information of which my natural forces are
completely incapable. And that's the whole point. There is absolutely no way in
which the natural form can achieve a supernatural inclination. It's just not
possible. The natural form is going to bump along the top of the limits of
nature. There's no way it can go through the ceiling into purely as a natural
information hitting a supernatural object. Or resulting in a supernatural
inclination. Absolutely no way.

Therefore, I can't have, just by my natural intellect, a desire to see God as
God, to supernaturally see God. It's not possible; it's absurd to suppose it.
Therefore, if I have an inclination towards God as God, it's only going to be by
some supernatural information. God must give me some supernatural information
before I'm going to be able to desire to see the supernatural God. That's just a
law of being.

### God as Author of Nature vs. God in Himself

You know the distinction between God as natural and God as supernatural. There is
the Holy Trinity in Himself, supernatural. And then the natural God is like my
comparison: the little heat shield on the bottom of the space satellite. The
amount of the Godhead that Lord God deployed in creating the natural universe is
a flick of His fingers. It's nothing compared with the Godhead in Himself. So this
is God in God.

Now, the natural inclination can go for the heat shield. Yes, God as the author
of nature. That I have necessarily got a desire to know, yes. Because I can pick
up with my intellect the natural effects, and therefore I want to know the natural
cause of these natural effects. And therefore I have a natural inclination to
know, a desire to know God as the author of nature, yes, a thousand times yes.
But from there, to wanting to know God as God is in Himself, there's no way I can
even imagine what God is in Himself, above and beyond the heat shield. The heat
shield is all that the effects tell me. Here I am with my natural powers of
intellect. Here are the effects, for instance, the beautiful sunset. The natural
effects climb to God the author of nature. There's no way in which they go
through to God as He is in Himself. No way. It's absolutely impossible. It's just
a law of nature, a law of being, because form and inclination correspond to one
another.

## Interpreting St. Thomas: The Natural Desire to See God

That's why, yet St. Thomas has these quotations which seem to say that we have a
natural desire to know God as He is in Himself, but those quotations of St. Thomas
need to be interpreted. The interpretation is that it's a natural, inefficacious
desire to see God. There's a word missing. A natural, elicit, inefficacious
desire, I think, is the word I'm looking for: elicit.

The only desire that the natural mind can have to see God in Himself is elicit.
If nobody ever had the Catholic faith, there's no way any of us would even know
that God was anything more than just the author of nature. Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost and all the rest, there's no way we could know that. All that we would know
would be the pure act; we would know that God is pure act, that He is one, that
He is perfect, that He is infinite, and all of those perfections which the reason
can grasp, like Aristotle grasped. For Him, we would desire to know. But that He
is three in one, one in three, and all of the rest of His supernatural perks, we
wouldn't even have an inkling of it. How could we desire it? It's impossible. What
we would have no knowledge of, we could have no natural desire of. It's only
because the faith tells us that He's much more than just the author of nature.

Every inclination, every form is followed by some inclination. And the
inclination corresponds to the form, and it can't exceed the form, obviously.
Because the form is the information of the inclination. The effect can't exceed
the cause. *Effectus non excedit causam*. And therefore the inclination can't
exceed the form. The appetite can't exceed the information.
*Ignoti nulla cupido* (Of the unknown, there is no desire). That should strictly
be *ignoti nulla est cupiditas*, but the expression is a little loose. *Nihil
volitum quin praecognitum* (Nothing is willed unless it is previously known).
It's such a law. If one studies St. Thomas, you see these things so clearly, you
get all pulled together so clearly with a few basic principles to possess the
whole thing. It's a very lightweight system, believe it or not. St. Thomas is
very lightweight baggage in the mind. With a few principles, you hold everything.

## Modernism's Blurring of Grace and Nature

This question is the whole question of naturalism. It's enormous. What's so strong
in St. Thomas is the clear distinction between grace and nature. And what the
modernists want to do is to blur grace and nature. One of the places where St.
Thomas comes, if you like, closest to blurring grace and nature, and where the
others therefore try to cart the horse through, is when he says that the intellect
has a natural desire to see God as He is in Himself, see the essence of God.

This was a great question at the time of Baius and Jansenius. Baius said that God
was forced to give us grace to correspond to that natural inclination, something
like that. If you say that the natural intellect has a handle on God as God,
you're blurring grace and nature. You're saying that grace is built into nature.
The Calvinists got it wrong because they wanted to affirm that grace is built
into us because we are the elect. And then, the modernists get it wrong for
another reason, but it's the same error and it's the same material of error. They
get it wrong because the modernists want to blur grace and nature. They want to
say that everybody has grace built into them, which is exactly what John Paul II
says. Grace is built into everybody, grace is built into nature. We're all born
with what I call *granatus*. *Granatus*, which is a total blend of grace and
nature.

So, you see why the modernists use this issue in order to arrive at the blurring
of grace and nature. Because if they affirm that the purely natural inclination
can have a supernatural object, they're denying the dividing line between grace
and nature, which is what they want to do. They use all the quotations of St.
Thomas Aquinas saying that the created intellect has a natural desire to see God
as He is in Himself. And that the principle behind that is that every effect
desires to rise as high as its cause. It's true, but it's only materially that the
supreme cause of this natural intellect is supernatural. There's no way in which
the purely natural intellect can...

### Elicit and Inefficacious Desire

Therefore, what the Thomists interpret St. Thomas to say is that, firstly, the
intellect has no instinctive push towards a supernatural object. It cannot have
an instinctive push, just like if I was thrown out of the window, I have an
instinctive push to fall. On the contrary, say the Thomists, there can be no
instinctive push of a natural faculty to a supernatural object. There cannot be.
It's just the laws of being, the laws of formation and inclination.

But, therefore, there's no instinctive push. On the other hand, there is an
elicit desire. Meaning I think about it; it's not instinctive, but I think about
it when I'm told, when I realize that God is much more than just the "space
shield." Then I say, "Gee whiz, wouldn't it be great to see God?" So that's an
elicit desire. The intellectual creature has an elicit inclination on the basis
of what he's told. If somebody tells me, "God is much more than just a space
shield," I'd say, "Oh, gee whiz. In that case, I'd love to see him." That's
perfectly reasonable. I can give him some extra information on the basis of which
I have an extra desire, yes. But again, it's an elicit, therefore it's not
instinctive. I have an instinctive push to know the space shield, but I only have
an elicit push to know God as God.

Secondly, it's an inefficacious desire. That is to say, it's a desire... "Oh, gee
whiz, I'd love to see him if it was possible." I don't know whether it is
possible. If I'm smart, I know that I've only got a brown faculty (natural
faculty). So if somebody tells me that there's something much more to the first
cause than just a brown space shield, I'd say, "Well, if he were willing to show
me, I'd love to see him as he is." So all that there is by way of natural
inclination in the rational creature to see God as God is an elicit and
inefficacious desire. That observes the laws of being. That's the Thomistic
answer. St. Thomas himself never worked it out as clearly as that, but the
Thomists coming after him needed to work this one out under the push of
Protestants, Calvinists, and then they needed to repeat that answer under the push
of the Modernists.

How did the Modernists dismiss St. Thomas? They call it Scholasticism or
Neo-Scholasticism. "How dinosaurish can you get?" They've got a scorn for
Scholasticism, as noted in *Pascendi*. With their historical minds, they
relativize Thomism: "Oh, it's just an answer which suited the Middle Ages."
But St. Thomas is reality, and reality doesn't change. The last magnificent gasp
of Neo-Scholasticism was the encyclical *Humani generis* in 1951 of Pius XII, in
which he said Scholasticism is it, because truth doesn't change, and these words
and this language have been worked out very precisely, often at the cost of blood.

## The Primacy of Dogma

Theology costs blood. You get it wrong, there's going to be blood in the streets.
You may think that moral theology is more interesting than dogma because you can
see the application. But it's dogma which is decisive because dogma governs moral
theology, just as being governs action. *Agere sequitur esse*. *Inclinatio
sequitur formam*. Form gives being, and inclination is action. Moral theology is
in every case determined by dogma, and therefore dogma is where it's at.

Father Godfrey was expounding this question last week, and one of the priests
said, "Well, what's the practical use of this?" This is the whole question of
Modernism, of de Lubac and these modern delinquents, Vatican II. It's all
confusion of grace and nature, all *granatus*.

### Critique of "Granatus" and John Paul II's Theology

I was saying about John Paul II, that his whole system is based upon a blending or
confusion of grace and nature. His whole system is that human beings are built
with a locked-in grace, a nature that has grace locked in. Therefore, when men
sin, all that they do is put a dent in their *granatus*. Sin just puts a nasty
little dent. Why only a little dent? Because God is so good, because God is love,
love, love. So since God is love, then *granatus* was only a little bit dented.
But *granatus* was very naughty, so Jesus died on the cross in order to make it
up to the Father. So then Jesus with his cross takes the dent out of *granatus*,
and the Father is happy again. That's the system of theology of John Paul II. And
of course, it follows from that that everybody is saved. And because he believes
that everybody is saved, he goes all over the world looking goofy and exchanging
hats and smiling at everybody.

I'm caricaturing obviously, but this is the basis of it. We pray for the Pope
here; I certainly believe he is Pope. But when I want to say how crazy the whole
thing is today, I don't mind caricaturing, because only if you highlight the
idiocy can you see just how grotesque it all is. And yet when he writes these
huge encyclicals, he manages to disguise *granatus*, talking for pages in more or
less old-fashioned language, so that unless you know what's going on, you can't
pick it out. It's incredible. He thinks that he is simply developing the same
doctrine just a little bit further. He does not believe that *granatus*
contradicts previous Catholic doctrine. Incredible. The devil has done a
masterpiece of deceiving.

The moral of the story is that theology, Catholic dogma, matters. It matters on
the bottom line more than moral theology. You may find these abstract questions
difficult to understand, but that's where it's at. This elicit, inefficacious
desire is crucial in order to maintain the huge difference between grace and
nature. For instance, elsewhere in question 113 of the *Prima Secundae*, St.
Thomas will say, "The least little movement in the order of grace outweighs the
totality of created nature." One Ave Maria prayed in the state of grace weighs
heavier than the entire Rockies, than the whole of the Milky Way put together.
That's the enormous difference between the order of grace and the order of nature.
There's a total intrinsic, absolute difference. But that's what they want to blur,
because they want to say man is divine, that man is a superb, dignified, worthy,
great, admirable, adorable creature. In other words, they want to say that man is
God. So man has got grace built into his nature, the supernatural divine is built
into our nature. That's the modern idea. Completely false. But from that flow a
cascade of false consequences. This question is enormous.

And you resolve it on this principle: a clash of two principles. One, every
intellect wants to know the cause of every effect. True. The other, every
inclination follows a form. The one principle seems to go from a natural
knowledge to God Himself, and the other principle says, "No, the natural
knowledge can only go to God as a space shield." But then the Thomists work it
out with great exactness.

## The Modern World's Sickness: Heresy

So heresy is blood. The poor modern world is sick with heresy. It's not sick for
lack of drains, computers, or medicine. It's sick with heresy. That's the modern
world's problem. It's not even sick with breaking the Ten Commandments, though of
course, it is. But the sickness with breaking the Ten Commandments follows upon
the sickness of heresy. So that's why in a classical seminary, so much time and
trouble and agony is spent teaching dogma.

People today are not easy to argue with. Their minds are gone. Most people can't
think. Their minds have been deliberately unhooked from reality so that their
wills are unhooked from the Ten Commandments. People want to be unhooked from
reality, and they got what they want. If you want to hook them back to reality,
the heart of the reality is dogma. Dogma is simply the statement of reality – the
organized, purified, exact statement of natural and supernatural reality. Most
people don't want reality just as they don't want truth. *Res et veritas
convertuntur* (Being and truth are convertible). Men today don't want *res* (the
thing, reality). They don't want *veritas* (the truth).

## The Need to Love Truth and Pray

It's a sad state of affairs. The most important thing is to pray. You and I have
to pray for love of the truth. It's not enough to know the truth; you have to
love the truth. If you don't love the truth, you may know it, but you'll lose it.
If you love error, or if you love the consequences of error, sooner or later,
either the mind will purify the will or the will will corrupt the mind. A man
can't live divided indefinitely. That's why St. Paul so often connects the
knowing of error and the practicing of immorality. Error and immorality go
intimately together, and truth and morality go intimately together. Truth and
falsehood are the foundation of right and wrong, not the other way around.

## Commentary on Revelation (Continued)

Heresy ends in blood. Verse 5 (Revelation 16): "And I heard the angel of the
waters... saying, 'Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast holy, and who hast
thus judged.' Because they have shed the blood of the saints and the prophets."
Abelard in the theology rooms, Arnold of Brescia on the streets of Rome. That's
inevitably how it is. On the contrary, if you teach the truth in the theology
rooms, you're going to get sanity on the streets, people obeying the Ten
Commandments.
"And thou hast given them blood to drink, for they are worthy." Verse 7: "And I
heard another from the altar saying... Even thus, O Lord God Almighty, true and
just are thy judgments."

That's an important thing to remember today. With the world going crazy, don't let
people tell you that God doesn't know what He's doing. The judgments of God in
this terrible situation are entirely exact and just. They're mysterious, but
they're true and just. The corrupt people deserve a corrupt president, a corrupt
government, corrupt judges, corrupt school teachers, corrupt university
professors. I'm afraid that's what the people want today. They don't want the
truth. They want Clinton, believe it or not, because Clinton represents liberty
from God, liberty from the old Christian religion.
I quoted Betty Friedan or Bella Abzug: "If we vote against Clinton, we're voting
for all those awful old Christian White men." Or, "A vote against Clinton is a
vote for the prehistoric sexist ancient ages." That's the way these minds think.
Clinton is the triumph of the anti-Christian way of life. The Christian way of
life had a noble defender in Henry Hyde. The Republicans in the House of
Representatives did a good job making sure the Senate would face the question. But
in the Senate, all the Democrats, without fail, voted in defense of Clinton,
whereas a few Republicans voted for him. And the Democrats accuse the Republicans
of party politics, and in the media, they get away with it. These things tell you
that the people want this corruption. It's deliberate. So the judgments of God
are just upon our naughty and wicked world.

Verse eight: "And a fourth angel..." We jump from ages one, two, three, to four,
five, six. The preachers against the Antichrist. "The fourth angel," in verse
eight, "poured out his vial upon the sun (S-U-N), and it was given unto him to
afflict men with heat and fire." The sun is the Antichrist, a false sun. When the
Christian preachers preach against the Antichrist, his only reaction will be to
become still more cruel.

We won't get any further than that today.
