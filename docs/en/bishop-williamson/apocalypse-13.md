Transcript of the talk by Bishop Williamson: The Antichrist and the False Church (Apocalypse 13)

# Apocalypse 13: The Antichrist and the False Church

Bishop Williamson continues his commentary on the Apocalypse, focusing on
Chapter 13's depiction of the two beasts. Bishop Williamson explains that
the first beast represents the Antichrist, who will mimic Christ's power
and universal reign while persecuting the saints for a limited time. He
states that the second beast symbolizes the false church, which will
arise from worldliness and serve as an instrument of the Antichrist, using
seductive doctrine and simulated virtue to lead men to adore the first
beast. 

Bishop Williamson links these prophecies to the current state of the
Church and the world, suggesting the present disorder reveals the patience
and faith of true saints. He interprets the number 666 as signifying the
Antichrist's human imperfection, pride, opposition to God's honor, and
denial of truth, contrasting it with the divine number seven.

## Introduction to Revelation Chapter 13

Continuing with Chapter 13 today. Satan will give the Antichrist all of his
own evil, his experience, and all possible power in mimicry of the hypostatic
union. God is to Jesus Christ equals Satan to the Antichrist. God is to
Christ as Satan is to the Antichrist. Satan is going to try to make with
the Antichrist a relation, as far as possible, like between God and Christ.

The Antichrist will feign to be dead, verse 3, and will rise again, like
the South, preserving his wound in order once more to ape the stigmata of
Christ. And it will obviously be on television. It will be on CBC, ANC,
ABC, and Universal.

## The First Beast: The Antichrist

Verse 4: "And they adored the dragon who gave power to the beast and they
adored the beast, saying, 'Who is like unto the beast? And who will be
able to fight with him?'" All carnal men—fleshly as opposed to spiritual—
all carnal men will glorify the Antichrist in an unparalleled triumph as
he rises from the dead. "And they adored the dragon who gave power to the
beast." So people are going to adore the Antichrist and adore Satan. They're
not far from it today, it's obvious. "And they adored the power of the beast,
and they adored the beast, saying, 'Who is like unto the beast? And who
will be able to fight with him?'"

Verse 5: "And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and
speaking blasphemies, and there was given him power to act for 42 months."
This is the verse that says the Antichrist's reign will be three and a half
years. The mouth and the pride of the Antichrist are let loose for a limited
three and a half years. The Antichrist is gonna reign supreme for a terrible
period, but it's limited. He is given a mouth and power to let loose, to
rage, to prevail, to dominate, for three and a half years, 42 months. Three
and a half years is the limited duration of the Antichrist's reign.

Verse 6: "And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme
His name and His tabernacle." "His tabernacle," the tabernacle of God is
the Catholic Church, "and those who dwell in Heaven." Against the Church
and against the Saints.

Verse 7: "And it was given him to make war upon the Saints and to conquer
them." So the Antichrist really is going to smash the Church, to all
appearances. To make war with the Saints. The Antichrist will physically
overwhelm Catholics. He will crush Catholics. Catholics will be crushed
by the Antichrist. It was given to him, notice. It is given him to... God in
his mysterious providence allows the Antichrist to prevail physically, just
like God is mysteriously allowing the predecessor of the Antichrist, like
William Jefferson So-and-so, to prevail today. Decent men hardly get a look
in. It's all that decent men can do to get their act together. Everything is
against them. Everything seems against them. Everything is at least made to
look as though it's against them by the vile media. Just keep thinking of
today and think of this, *sunt idem* (they are the same).

"And it was given him to make war upon the Saints and to conquer them. It
was given him power over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and race."
Compare the universal empire of the Messiah. Again, the Antichrist is aping
Christ. Christ's reign is universal. The Antichrist will make a point of
making his reign universal. His empire will be universal like the Messiah's.
Daniel 7:14. The universality of the empire of the Messiah. The Antichrist
is at all points aping Christ.

Verse 8: "And they all adored it... All who dwell upon the Earth adored the
beast, all those whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb,
who was slain from the origin of the world." A little tricky. "All worldly
men, all carnal men," again, "all worldly men not written in the Book of
Life. All worldly men..." In other words, the world, people are divided
between the servants of the world and the servants of Christ. The world is
against Christ, Christ is against the world. "All worldly men will be totally
at the service of the Antichrist." "All worldly men will be totally at the
service of the Antichrist who have not profited from the graces of the Lamb."
They've all received graces of the Lamb, but they've by no means all profited
from the graces of the Lamb. All those who turn away the Lamb will adore the
Antichrist. By the Lamb's graces alone, since the beginning of the world,
men can be saved. That's what this means from the... He was killed from the
beginning of the world. That's what that means. By the graces of the Lamb
alone since the beginning of the world, men can be saved. Adam was saved.
If Adam was saved, Church fathers teach that Adam and Eve did long penance,
but they were saved. They were saved by the grace of Jesus Christ. There's no
other grace by which anybody can be saved. So from the beginning of the world,
the Lamb was slain in the sense that it is by the grace of Jesus Christ that
anybody at all from the beginning of mankind was saved. Now, the grace of
Jesus Christ is the graces of the slain Lamb because his grace comes by his
passion and death. Therefore, the grace of the Lamb was slain from the
beginning of the world. So all those who have not profited by the graces of
the Lamb, who therefore are not written in the Book of Life, will be blinded
and adoring the Antichrist because the only way in which anybody could be
saved is by the grace of the slain Lamb, that grace which was available
from the beginning of the world. I hope that's clear. It is reasonable.

Notice the... Once again, the crusading blindness of Paul VI in this long
letter in which he's trying to take the archbishop to cleanness. On the one
hand, he's so wrong. On the other hand, he's completely convinced. He's locked
into his error. He's blind, absolutely blind. It's a terrible punishment,
that kind of blindness. I think I said to you that there is a story, I have
no idea if there's a grain of truth in it or not, there is a story that at
the end of his life, Pope Paul VI made a confession which turned the hair
of the young priest hearing his confession white. I don't know if that story
is true. You know, you know nothing about any of this true or false coming
out of this Vatican. You have got no idea if anything's true coming out of it.
That's the story that comes up. *Se non è vero, è ben trovato*, the Italians
say. "If it's not true, it's well found." If it isn't true that his confession
turned the hair white of a young priest listening to it, hey, it's still,
it's on target. It's *ben trovato*. It's literally well found. Somebody thought
it up. It's well thought up. *Ben trovato*. Well thought up. If it isn't true,
it's well thought up. In other words, if it isn't true, it's very like the
truth. It would have been an enormous grace for Paul VI to see at the end
of his life. But, gosh, imagine his responsibility if he has gone to hell.
But the terrible blindness. There was a French mystic who when he became pope
said he wanted it. She knew perfectly well that it was a deadly thing, both
for him and for the church, for him to have become pope, but he wanted it.
He wanted to be pope, and he became pope. For his own downfall, for his own
wretchedness, for his own misery, for his own punishment. And the moment he
became pope, he began pushing through this incredible program of transforming
the Catholic Church. John Paul II was similar, but they're blind, blind.
Terrible punishment. Beg God not to let you go blind. The greatest blinder?
Pride is right, pride. Because if I want... The disordered appetite of one's
own excellence, the disordered desire of one's own excellence is the definition
of pride, and these modernists want to set themselves up in the place of God.
It's as simple as that. They want to change the church. God was the maker of
the church, they want to be remakers of the church. They want to be like gods
once again. So it's pride. And if I'm so keen on my own excellence, I'm gonna
deliberately blind myself to anything that's against that excellence or a
reality that puts me back in my place, I'm gonna blind myself to it. I'm
gonna see only those things that lift me up and puff me up. That's the
blindness of pride.

## The Patience and Faith of the Saints

Verse 9: "If anybody has an ear, let him hear." Those who have ears for
spiritual things, pay attention. Those who have ears for things spiritual,
pay attention.

Verse 10: "He who will have led into captivity will go himself into captivity.
Who will have killed with the sword must himself be killed by the sword. Here
is the patience and faith of the saints." So this is the last word. Well, the
last word in Chapter 13 on the Antichrist. It's not the last word in the whole
of the Apocalypse on the Antichrist, but it's the last word here. It's like
a little conclusion. If anybody has ears to hear, let them hear. Listen to
this. The triumph of the Antichrist will be short-lived. He will in turn
be punished. Three and a half years. Queen Elizabeth I of England is meant
to have prayed to God. Again, I don't know if it's true. She said, "Just let
me be queen for 40 years and then I don't mind what you do with my soul." I
mean, it's not she prayed for that. To who did she pray to? Maybe she prayed
to the devil. I mean, I'm not... That's not the kind of prayer God would grant.
But she's meant to have prayed for just 40 years. She had... She got exactly
that. She got 40 years of reign and then she went to the devil. Terrible death,
Queen Elizabeth I. They brought in one of the Anglican priests that she had so
established. She set up the Anglican Church. When she was dying they brought
in an English priest. She said, "You're only a hedge priest. Get out of here."
She knew exactly what she'd done. She knew the church she set up was bogus.
"You're a hedge priest. Get out of here." She was a terrible woman. Terrible,
terrible woman. Very powerful. A real Jezebel.

The triumph of the Antichrist will be short-lived. He will... If imprisoned,
he will be imprisoned. If he will have killed with the sword, he will be
killed with the sword. However, "here is the patience and faith of the
saints." He will in turn be punished not without having shown up the patience,
not without having brought out the patience and faith of true saints. Not
without having highlighted, not without having provoked, not without having
caused, not without having been the occasion of the patience and faith of the
true saints. That's of course why God will have allowed the Antichrist, because
there will be, we're told, several of the greatest saints in all the history
of the church, and their greatness will be shown by the terribleness of the
persecution. All that happens on this earth is for the sake of the saints.
St. Augustine says it in the Holy Week liturgy: "If God allows evil men,
it's either so that they should convert or that they should put good men to
the trial." It's Augustine, in Holy Week. One of the readings. You've got
to work out whether it's... That's all we think about, what it's actually
saying, you know? I mean, come on. You can't expect too much.

## The Second Beast: The False Church

The second beast of the Apocalypse. The dragon is Satan. The first beast is
the Antichrist, and the second beast is more or less the false church. The
false church. Just, let's just say that today, watching what's going on today,
to say that the second beast is the false church is something you could never
have said in a Catholic seminary 50 years ago. "Oh! Unimaginable blasphemy!"
But today, unfortunately, look around you. So just cast the light upon the
second beast of the false church and you can... He comes to life. The second
beast is the servants of the Antichrist.

Verse 11: "And I saw another beast arising from the earth, and he had two
horns similar to the lamb, but he spoke like the dragon." So he's a false
lamb. Got it? This is a false lamb. The servants of the Antichrist with
intelligence, eloquence, and talent. Arising, the first beast arose from the
sea. The second beast arises from the land. Some people equate the red dragon
with communism. And again, there's plenty of application there. The red dragon
is Satan, but communism is satanic and therefore what's said about Satan can
to a great extent be said about communism. So there are... Don't think that
any one of these applications excludes others. There are spiritual patterns
which repeat down history.

Arising not from the depths of perversity, i.e., from the sea, like the
first beast, but arising from worldliness, i.e., from the earth. From the
desire to obtain by the Antichrist glory, wealth, etc. Malachi Martin, I
think, says that the motivation of the churchmen of the new church is to
obtain a place in the sun in the new world order. It makes sense. They want
to be prominent and glorious in the new world order. In other words, they
want to receive from the Antichrist. So the second beast wants to receive
from the first beast. It rises from the earth, from the desire to obtain by
the Antichrist, glory, wealth, and everything else this world has to give. So
the second beast is working in conjunction with the first. The false lamb
works in conjunction with the Antichrist. The new church is already working
in conjunction with the new world order. In this fifth age of the church, we
can already see the partnership. It's very clear.

The two horns, verse 11, are seductive doctrine, once again, intellect and
will, doctrine and virtue. Seductive doctrine, in other words, false doctrine,
and simulated virtue. Pretended virtue in the will, pretended truth in the
intellect. Firstly, pretended truth in the intellect, error in the intellect,
but seductive error. And then pretended virtue in the will, again, false. It's
false. The second beast is a false lamb. Pretends to be like the first lamb,
which is why you can definitely say it's like... it's the false church. The
Lamb is the bride of the Lamb of God, and the false lamb is the false church.
Two horns, seductive doctrines, simulated virtue.

But it spoke like the dragon. The language of the second beast is filled
with pride, blasphemy, and hypocrisy. That's the new church today. Its
language is full of pride, blasphemy, and hypocrisy. Glory to man in the
highest. Pride. God is at the service of man. Blasphemy. Vatican Two is the
greatest council there ever has been. Hypocrisy. Bazillion examples. The
talk of the false lamb is filled with pride, blasphemy, and hypocrisy.

Verse 12: "And he executed all the power of the first beast in the sight
of the first beast, and he made the earth and those dwelling upon the earth
adore the first beast whose deadly wound was cured." So, that's the Antichrist
again. So, the false church makes everybody bow down in front of the Antichrist.
It makes sense, because the false church has got spiritual clout because it
is a false church. The false lamb makes everybody bow down in front of the
Antichrist. The power of the Antichrist will be communicated to the false
lamb. "And he executed all power of the first beast." The Antichrist gives
all of his clout to the false church. However, "he executed all power of the
first beast in the sight of the first beast." In other words, only
instrumentally, never without the principle. The second beast acts always
only instrumentally as an instrument of the first beast. He carries out all
of his power only in the sight of the first beast, meaning never separately
from the first beast. The second beast is only the instrument of the first
beast. The first beast is to the second as principle to instrumental.
Principle cause to instrumental cause. Just so you don't think I've misspelled
principle. As principle to instrumental. The first beast is to the second as
principle to instrumental. The second beast is to the first as instrument
to the principle. All right. So he's carrying out the full power of the first
beast, only always in the sight of the first beast. In other words, always
as instrument of the first beast.

And the second beast, the false lamb, will lead all mankind to adore the first
beast. So the second beast, the false church, is going to put people in the
service of the Antichrist. The new church today is putting people in the
service of the new world order. Clear. Clear, clear, clear. Yoking people
to the new world order. The false church will lead mankind to adore the first
beast, to adore the Antichrist.

Verse 13: "And he did great signs so as to make fire descend down from heaven
upon earth in the sight of men." Fire from heaven. The second beast will have
power to ape Pentecost, the fire from heaven. The devil is always aping God,
because he wants to be like God. So fire from heaven, he's going to ape fire
from heaven. It's going to be a new Pentecost, just like Vatican II. Pope John
Paul II keeps on saying that Vatican II is a new Pentecost. All of those
Neo-Modernists believe that. They believe the church only began with Vatican
II. For 1900 years the church has been teaching that the good news is that
Christ has redeemed us just so long as we want to cooperate. But Vatican II
tells us that the really good news is that we're all of us saved whether we
cooperate or not. Only for 1900 years the church has been blind to what the
real good news is. The church has been locked up in darkness and shadows and
pessimism. We are emerging in the bright, brave new world of knowing that
everybody is saved. John Paul II teaches that. He teaches it clearly. He
believes it. And the Holy Ghost is the continuer of the good news, of the
good news that we're all saved. And thus, when any man has any pangs of
conscience that proves that the Holy Ghost is at work. If the Holy Ghost is
at work, that's sanctifying grace. If there's sanctifying grace, that's
conversion. Therefore, any pangs of conscience are conversion. So all those
who have any kind of pangs in their conscience are converted. They're good
guys, they're Catholics, fine, no problem. And who's the best good guy of all?
Who is Mr. Nice Guy *par excellence*? Hog love. Hog love. The Holy Ghost
who is love. Amen and amen. That's it. That's what Pope John Paul II teaches.
The greatest good guy of all... Ah, he doesn't put it quite like that. But he
takes this doctrine that the Holy Ghost is love, that the Holy Ghost is gift,
and makes it into the fact that the Holy Ghost is the conversion of everybody.
The Holy Ghost is everybody's conversion. The Holy Ghost is present in every
man. The Holy Ghost is divine, therefore every man is divine, et cetera, et
cetera, et cetera. I mean, you know, it's... From the point of view of Catholic
theology it's absolutely childish, childish. He just takes the words and
fools around with them how he likes. And he's been pope for 20 years. And he
means well. And he's convinced. Isn't it fun? Yeah, that's why you're here.

I've been having to look at, in some length and depth and breadth, the
encyclical on *Dona Vita Candidam*. This latest book of Professor Dumm, the
fourth book of Professor Dumm, is about the encyclical on the Holy Ghost.
It's hair-raising, absolutely hair-raising. God comes up to a man. The Holy
Ghost comes up to a man. God, the Holy Ghost opens himself, opens the depths
of God to the man. The man then, well, opens himself. "Ah, thank you," says
the Holy Ghost. "You're converted." Isn't it nice? Have you ever heard anything
so lovely? I tell you. Oh, man. Unbelievable, but I think he's pope. I
personally still think he is pope. One, because he is too dumb to know what he
is doing. He's book smart, but that doesn't mean to say you're smart. He's
book smart, but outside of books he is dumb. As dumb as his feet. And the
other thing is that he, there's no authority above him that can back him
up against the wall and say, "Look, you are as dumb as your feet, and this
is why. Do you recognize it?" He says, "Yes, I do." "All right, well then
do you recant?" "Yes." Okay, then he's no heretic. Or he says, "No, I don't...
I, I, this is... Love, love, love is what life's all about, and this is the
truth, and this is the good news." In that case you're a heretic, boom.
That's it. There's no authority above the pope that can authoritatively
confront him with his material heresies so as to make them into formal
heresy. And as long as it's not formal heresy, God can allow... You can see
from the Book of the Apocalypse here, that God can allow an extraordinary
amount of disorder and persecution of his church. He can. His church can
seem almost to go under by the wickedness of men. That's what's happening
today. Five equals seven. Five closely parallels the seven. The fifth age
of the church, close parallel to the seventh age of the church. That's why
what we are experiencing today is like what we're now reading about the
Antichrist.

## Seduction and the Image of the Beast

All right, we go on. Verse 14: "And he seduced, the second beast seduced those
dwelling upon the earth because of the signs which were given it to do in the
sight of the first beast." "Telling the inhabitants upon earth that they should
make an image of the first beast, which would have the sword wound and which
lived." So they're going to be circulated like pictures of the Sacred Heart
with a great, with a wound in their heart. They're gonna be pictures, holy
cards of the first beast circulated, and the second beast will sell the holy
cards of the first beast in order to get everybody to adore the first beast
and to admire how he rose from the dead. Image, the second beast, having
seduced all carnal men... Like the new church today seducing easily most
Catholics, it does give them an easy deal. The second beast, having seduced
all carnal men, will tell them to ape images of the Sacred Heart, will instruct
them, will guide them, will push them to ape images of the Sacred Heart with
images of the wounded and resurrected Anti-Christ.

Verse 15: "And it was given to the second beast to give spirit to the image of
the first beast such that the image of the first beast should speak and bring
about that whoever did not adore the image of the first beast should be killed."
So maybe it's not holy cards of the Sacred Heart, maybe it's gonna be one
statue which will be on worldwide television, it'll be on satellite TV, and
everybody will see the second beast coming up, the false lamb coming up to the
image of the first beast and sort of doing abracadabra, and then hey presto,
the image of the first beast is gonna speak. It'll be on TV and everybody will
be, "Ah." All the televidiots, "Ah." Well, it's gonna be quite a scene. The
second beast will have power from devils through the Anti-Christ to make the
images of the Anti-Christ talk. Maybe one image, maybe many. Maybe singular for
singular, maybe singular for plural. The second beast will have power from
devils through the Anti-Christ. Always remember the second beast's power is
instrumental and dependent upon the Anti-Christ's principal power. The second
beast will have power to make the images of the Anti-Christ talk and to kill
all who refuse to adore. It's gonna be tough.

## The Mark of the Beast

Verse 16: "And he will make all the weak, and the great, and the rich, and the
poor, and the freemen, and the slaves to have a character upon their right hand
or on their foreheads such that nobody can buy or sell unless they have that
character or the name of the beast or the number of his name, which is 666,
verse 18." The second beast will oblige all men to bear a mark of the first
beast without which they won't be able to buy or sell anything.

Figuratively, back to verse 14, figuratively speaking, this again is a second
layer of interpretation, all men will have to model their behavior on that of
the Antichrist, verse 14. Verse 15, the images speaking are the followers of
the Antichrist babbling in tongues, etc. The followers of the Antichrist
babbling in tongues. Verse 16, the character, and he will make all the freemen
and slaves, rich and poor and so on, everybody will have a character upon
their right hand or upon their forehead. The character will be some rite, some
ceremony aping baptism which of course imprints a sacramental character. Some
ceremony aping baptism. Only it won't be in the name of the Father, of the Son,
the Holy Ghost, it won't be in the name of the Holy Trinity, it will be in the
name of the 666. Some ceremony aping baptism in the number, not of the Holy
Trinity, but three, but verse 18, 666.

## The Number 666

Verse 18: "Here is wisdom. He that has understanding, let him calculate the
number of the beast, for it is the number of a man and the number is 666."
In this terrible crisis, wisdom will be needed to see that the Antichrist is
neither God nor an angel, but just a man. The number is the number of a man.
In this terrible crisis, the worst ever in the history of the church, wisdom is
going to be needed to see that the Antichrist is neither God nor angel, but just
a man. Once again, Catholics, fasten your seat belts, don't lose your heads.
Don't despair and don't give up.

There are all kinds of theories about 666. Here are just a few that Dom Mollion
judges to be the most serious. By Greek numbering, alpha equals one, beta
equals two, gamma equals three, delta equals four, epsilon equals five, zeta
equals six, eta equals seven, theta equals eight, et cetera. By Greek
numbering, the Church Fathers single out three Greek words with a number
value of 666. They are the Greek words for giant, contrary honor, and I deny:
Titan, An Timeos, and Arnaumai. Giant, contrary honor, and I deny. Therefore,
say the Church Fathers, Catholics should situate the Antichrist by 666. 666
enables us to situate the Antichrist as a giant of pride, contrary to the
honor of God, and denying all truth. That's the Church Fathers. A giant of
pride opposing the honor of God and denying all truth.

Also, as seven is the number of completion or perfection (seven sacraments,
seven days, seven ages, gifts of the Holy Ghost, days of creation), so six
is incompleteness and imperfection. Therefore, triple six is triple
incompleteness. The Antichrist will never enter into the peace of God's seventh
day or Sabbath. The Antichrist will never enter into the peace and protection
of God's seventh day or Sabbath. I think you can see that as commentary upon
666, that's extremely sober. It quotes church fathers and it just quotes six
being the figure of incompletion and imperfection, which again, is well
known. Therefore, 666 is triple imperfection. Therefore, the Antichrist is a
bad guy. That's fairly sober.

There are all kinds of interpretations of 666. Like there are all kinds of
interpretations of many other things in the Book of the Apocalypse wrapped
in mystery.

## Questions and Discussion

Any questions on Chapter 13? Is it possible that the Antichrist will be a
bishop? Some people say he's going to be the son of a bishop and a Jewess,
something like that. But himself a clergyman, I don't think so. No. He wouldn't
be glamorous enough. You couldn't capture the world's admiration as a
clergyman, even as an apostate clergyman. To get the world going, you'd
have to completely throw aside all trace of being a clergyman. Don't you
think so? To get the world going? I think so, yeah.

Any other questions? I forget who prophesies the... Our Lady of La Salette said
he will be the son... I think Our Lady of La Salette said something about it.
He will be the son of... in The Secret of La Salette, I think it is. The son
of a bishop, a Catholic... son of a Catholic bishop and a Jewess, I think. I
can't remember. Jewish rabbinate. Something like that, a Jewish name, something
of that order. Who knows?

All right, there will be an exam in six days time. I advise you, know the text.
Look, 13 chapters is really not all that much. I admit it's difficult, I mean,
it's obviously mysterious and so on. I advise you to sort of construct a
schema. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then you're going to have
letters and you're going to have seals, and then trumpets, and then the dragon.
So what ages? Obviously, the letters is one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven. The seals is one, two, three, I think four... and then it's whatever
it is. Work out against the seven ages of the church. Somehow or other you'll
get examined on it.
