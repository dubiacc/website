Bishop Williamson provides an exegesis of the Epistle of Jude, focusing on its
prophecies of moral decay and rebellion, and then introduces the First Epistle of
Peter, affirming its apostolic authorship and historical connection to Rome.

# Jude 1: Warnings and Peter's Roman Foundation

Bishop Williamson explains Jude's depiction of corrupt men who blaspheme the unknown
and are debased by natural knowledge, likening them to followers of Cain, Balaam,
and Core in their rebellion against authority. 

He says Jude describes false teachers as unstable and fruitless, prophesying mockers in the last days who are sensual and
lack the Spirit. Bishop Williamson then introduces 1 Peter, recounting the Apostle's
life, ministry, and martyrdom in Rome ("Babylon"). 

He affirms Peter's role as the first Bishop of Rome, citing scriptural, traditional, and archaeological evidence,
and establishes the authenticity of 1 Peter through external and internal proofs.

## Commentary on the Epistle of Jude

### The Nature of Corrupt Men (Jude 1:8-10)

These men blaspheme whatever things they know not, and what things soever they
naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted. As we saw in
verse 9, that is an episode which must have happened over the body of Moses.
Whether or not it is related in a dubious source, since it is quoted here,
that is for certain and true. And it is picked up again, as I was saying to you,
in the prayer after Mass of Saint Michael; the phrase *Imperet illi Deus* comes
from here. Michael is content to say—he does not give him an argument—he just
tells him to get lost. An appeal to authority: "The Lord command thee." That
must have been the end of the argument.

So, verse 10: "These men blaspheme whatsoever things they know not, and what
things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted."
That is a picture of many people today. They scorn anything that is above them
that they do not know about—a scorn for higher things. And the things they do
know, they behave like beasts. In these they are corrupted. A mass of newspaper
readers today are like that. And the newspapers pander to their scorn for higher
things, and then pander to their wallowing in lower things.

### Historical Examples of Rebellion (Jude 1:11)

#### Cain, Balaam, and Core

"Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain." You have the references
there: Genesis 4:8, obviously the killer of Abel. "The error of Balaam, they
have for reward poured out themselves." Numbers 22 and 23. Balaam was the
prophet who brilliantly advised the enemies of Israel to corrupt Israel.
He said to King Balak, "Look, you are not going to defeat them because they are
defended by God, unless you make them enemies of God. As long as they are friends
of God, they are invincible. So the way to beat them is to make them enemies of
God." Exactly like the Communists have done with the West. The Communists knew
they could not beat the West, and so what the Communists, or the Jews, have done
is corrupt the West: pornography, abortion, et cetera. The Communists are into
rock music. The Communists and Jews—it is the same thing—they know how to
corrupt the Gentiles and thus to defeat the West and conquer it.

Balaam, Numbers 22:33, that is probably the reference to his... oh, that is the
reference to the ass, actually. The verse they give you is where the ass, or the
donkey, stops Balaam. Numbers 16:32? No, "the error" refers to...
Challoner refers to that verse about Balaam beating the ass. I do not know why.
But where do you find Balaam giving his satanic advice to Balak? I cannot remember,
but it may even not be in Numbers. It may be in another book of Scripture that
it is told that Balaam gave that advice to Balak. The satanic advice was to make
the Israelites sin, and then God will no longer be their friend, and then you
can defeat them. And that is very often the case.

"The error of Balaam, they have for reward poured out themselves, and have
perished in the contradiction of Core." That is the revolt. Numbers 16:32-33.

#### The Revolt of Core and the Divine Confirmation of Authority

The revolt of Dathan, Abiron, and Core, that is Numbers 16. The three members—
were they Levites? Dathan and Abiron were children of Reuben. They revolted
against the authority of Moses. And they are the three that were told to
separate themselves. Moses told everybody to keep away from them, and then they
were swallowed up; the earth opened and swallowed them up. And from then on, the
authority of Moses was established. That is Numbers 16.

An interesting thing to note there: "And the Lord said to Moses, 'Command the
whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Kore and Dathan and
Abiron.' Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiron, and the ancients of Israel
followed him. And he said to the multitude, 'Depart from the tents of these
wicked men. Touch nothing of theirs.' And when they were departed from their
tents round about, Dathan and Abiron came out, stood in the entry of their
pavilions with their wives and children. Moses said, 'By this you will know that
the Lord hath sent me to do all the things that you see, and that I have not
forged them of mine own head.'" Interesting, you see? "My authority is from God,
and it is not me. I am not on an ego trip. That I have not forged them out of my
own head. If these men die the common death, and if they be visited with a plague,
like everyone else, then I was not sent by God. But if the Lord does a new thing,
and opens up the earth and swallows them down, and everything they belong to, and
they go alive into hell, then you will know that my authority is from God, and
that by blaspheming my authority, they have been blaspheming God."

"Immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under
their feet, and opening her mouth devoured them with their tents and all their
substance. And they went down alive into hell, the ground closing upon them, and
they perished from among the people. But all Israel that was standing round about
fled at the cry of them that were perishing, saying, 'Lest perhaps the earth
swallow us up also.'" Which suggests that the Israelites got the message.
"And a fire coming out from the Lord destroyed the 250 men that offered the
incense." Then the lawful priesthood, Eleazar, the son of Aaron, picks up again.

So, interesting that authority had to be confirmed from on high. And that is how
it is again today. Authority in the Church has been so rocked and so undermined
by the misbehavior of men that it is going to take another divine manifestation
to restore clout to authority, secular and religious, I think you can say.
Democracy has made such a monkey of secular authority, and churchmen have made
such a monkey of Church authority, that it is going to take an act of God to
re-establish authority. Because authority does come from God, ultimately. And
that example from Moses shows Him Himself establishing, re-establishing
authority. It has happened also in the Church all the time with miracles.
Miracles give churchmen authority. Miracles gave Padre Pio tremendous authority
because people know that God is with him if he works miracles. But something
like the thunder and lightning on Mount Sinai or the earth swallowing up these
rebels—they have perished in the contradiction of Core. These heretics that Jude
is talking about are disputing authority. They are rebels. They are animals.
They are rebels and animals, like so many people today. They are proud. People
today are proud of their rebellious spirit. Just look at the way they stand, the
way schoolchildren behave, the way they dress. Everything breathes rebellion. Look
at statues of Thomas Jefferson; they just breathe revolt.

### Characteristics of False Teachers (Jude 1:12-13)

Verse 12: "These false doctors are stains," or spots, "in their banquets,
feasting together without fear." It is Friday nights and Saturday nights with no
fear, without the fear of God, with no respect. They do not respect anything or
anybody, and they are proud of not respecting anything or anybody. Very much like
people are today. "Feeding themselves. Clouds without water, carried about by
winds." What is a cloud if it has no water? It is useless. It just blocks the
sun and does not water anything. Completely unstable, completely insubstantial,
serving no useful purpose, drifting around, blocking out the sun, carried about
by winds. "Trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the
roots." Trees, again, are useful for their fruits. These characters are fruitless.
"Twice dead, plucked up by the roots." Twice dead? Hmm.

Verse 13: "Raging waves of the sea." You frequently had in the Apocalypse the sea
as an image of the Gentiles or as an image of the world: unstable, dangerous,
undrinkable, unreliable, unpredictable, just sloshing around, "foaming out their
own confusion; wandering stars to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for
ever." Hell, obviously. Notice the rootlessness. Again, people today are
rootless. A rolling stone gathers no moss. People today drift around and do not
stay in one place, do not put down roots. And because they do not put down roots,
they do not bear fruit. In order to bear fruit, you have got to put down roots,
metaphorically speaking. Rootless. They are going to finish up in hell.

### Enoch's Prophecy and the Ungodly (Jude 1:14-16)

Now, Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying... This is from one of
these doubtful, apocryphal books, the Book of Enoch. He was prophesying, saying,
"Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon
all." So Enoch prophesied the last coming, the end of the world. "To execute
judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for all their works of their
ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly, and of all the hard things which
ungodly sinners have spoken against God." Well, today, speaking against God,
there is no end of it.

These are murmurers. That is a sin, murmuring. What commandment is that? The
eighth commandment, is it not? Murmuring. Anybody remember from moral theology?
Murmuring. What is that? Is it *murmuratio*? Maybe that is the Latin word for it.
In any case, they are always talking down, talking behind people's backs, and
usually talking down authority. You cannot live like that. A society cannot live
like that because society needs authority. Society cannot exist without authority
because authority is the efficient cause of society. And so, to talk down
authority is grave. You may remember the respect our Lord had for Annas and
Caiaphas in His passion, and the respect of Paul in front of the Jewish
authorities in Jerusalem. Even when they were talking nonsense, he regretted
having said so when he found out that it was the high priest. The respect for
authority. On the contrary, these people that Jude is talking about, no respect
for authority, murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own
desires, and their mouths speaketh proud things, admiring persons for gain's sake.
Money, money, money, or gain. Today, obviously.

### Apostolic Warnings of Mockers in the Last Times (Jude 1:17-19)

"But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken
before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ." That is the verse which
suggested to some commentator that perhaps Jude is one of the last apostles to
die. It is not certain. In any case, the people that Jude is writing to have
obviously been exposed in one way or another to the preaching of the other
apostles. "Who told you that in the last time there would come mockers walking
according to their own desires and ungodliness."

God allowed the early Christians—obviously from 1 and 2 Thessalonians,
especially 2 Thessalonians—it is clear that the early Christians thought that the
end of the world was coming soon. They thought that soon after Christ would come
the general judgment. And 2 Thessalonians is very much to get rid of that
mistake. Still, the idea is around. And of course, always, the general judgment
is as close as any particular person's death. That is when he achieves the state
in which he will go through the general judgment. So, in that sense, everybody
is close to their general judgment.

But, "in the last time there should come mockers walking according to their own
desires and ungodliness." Whatever even Jude himself perhaps thought that time
was, it is, in fact, the last time, obviously about 2,000 plus years after
Christ. So, they were mistaken materially, but formally, it remains true. "In the
last time will come mockers walking according to their own desires and
ungodlinesses." You have got two passages speaking about the ungodliness of people
in the last times. 2 Timothy 3:1-6, where it actually refers you to Jude 1:18:
"Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times." And
1 Timothy 4:1: "The spirit manifesteth that in the last time some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils,
speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared." So those are two
other passages portraying the men of the last times, which is our times really.
We are not far from the end of the world surely. Also, there is a reference in
2 Peter 3:3: "In the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers walking after
their own lusts saying, 'Where is his promise or his coming?'" Et cetera. So
those are other paragraphs saying the same thing as Jude says here: the prophecy
of the horribleness, the decadence of men, the degeneracy of men at the end of
the world.

"Mockers walking according to their own desires and ungodliness. These are they
who separate themselves, sensual men, having not the spirit." Men who mark
themselves out as animal rather than spiritual; *psuchikoi* instead of
*pneumatikoi*. Compare 1 Corinthians 2:14. You may remember Saint Paul speaking
about spiritual and animal man: that the spiritual man can judge the animal man,
but the animal man cannot. "The sensual man perceiveth not these things that are
of the spirit of God for it is foolishness to him and he cannot understand
because it is spiritually examined. But the spiritual man judgeth all things and
he himself is judged of no one." So for spiritual and animal, see
1 Corinthians 2:14.

### Exhortations to the Faithful (Jude 1:20-23)

"Sensual men having not the spirit. But you my beloved, building yourselves upon
your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost." Faith is the foundation.
"Praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto life everlasting. And some indeed reprove"—
that is a second person plural imperative, not a third person plural indicative.
'Some' is accusative, 'reprove' is imperative. "Rebuke some being judged,"
meaning they are fit to be condemned. "Others save"—again, an imperative—"pulling
them out of the fire. Pulling them off the road to eternal fire. On others have
mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal." Be careful of
getting too close to sensuality because it might catch you as well. So, have mercy
in fear of getting caught in the trap that others are caught in, the sensual trap
that others are caught in.

### Doxology (Jude 1:24-25)

"Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless
before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy in the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ." That is obviously to God who can keep you without sin, and who can
present you without sin before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy in
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. "To the only God our Savior through Jesus
Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages
and now and for all ages of ages, amen."

Any questions on Jude? That is another book of scripture that you have studied.
Interesting, very relevant so to speak. Very much the state of things or people
today.

### Question Regarding St. Michael the Archangel

Yes? (Questioner asks about Michael the Archangel being an archangel, one of the
seven spiritual powers, yet leading the heavenly host).
Michael the Archangel, so he is an archangel. Yes. And therefore he is one of
the seven spiritual powers originally. That is a question I have never known the
answer to. How is it that somebody from the second lowest rank of angels, or the
second lowest choir of angels, headed up the defense of the whole of heaven, and
headed up the throwing out of Lucifer? I have never known the answer to that
question. Does anybody know what is said about that? I do not know. You would
have thought that... What does it say here about him? "Michael the Archangel
disputing with the devil." It does not say here much. I do not know, maybe God
wanted to demonstrate to Lucifer that a sergeant was enough to kick him out.
It is an interesting question.

Regarding a reference in the Apocalypse to the seven spirits around the throne of
God, I am not sure. Where was that? Was it Apocalypse chapter 10, talking about
Michael? "And I saw another mighty angel." No, that was not Michael in chapter 10.
I do not know. I would have to look it up in a good encyclopedia or reference.
There must be a simple answer to that question about Michael, and I have never
known it. I will see if I can find out. Anything else on Jude? All right.

## Introduction to the First Epistle of Peter

Turn to 1 Peter. This is the first of all the Church's encyclicals, so to speak.
1 Peter. There are two epistles of Peter amongst the seven Catholic Epistles, as
they are called. 1 Peter has five chapters; 2 Peter has three chapters. So, a
little background information on 1 Peter.

### The Apostle Peter: Life and Ministry

The story of Peter. Well, we know who Peter is: the chief apostle, the first
pope, first bishop of Rome. Acts 12:17: Peter had just been rescued from prison
by the prayers of the faithful. "When they had opened, they saw him and were
astonished. But he, beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, told
how the Lord had brought him out of prison and said, 'Tell these things to James
and to the brethren.' And going out, he went into another place." So having been
rescued from prison, it looks as though Peter thought that the wise thing to do
was to leave Jerusalem because if Herod found out that he had got out of jail,
he would have thrown him into jail again. So the prudent thing was to get out. At
that point, it looks as though Peter left Jerusalem.

#### From Jerusalem to Antioch

He is back in Jerusalem in AD 49 or 50 for the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15).
We know from Saint Paul that he was in Antioch (Galatians 2:11-14), the famous
passage about, "I withstood Peter to his face." It is generally accepted that
Peter was Bishop of Antioch. After Jerusalem, he went to Antioch. He was Bishop
of Antioch, which was a major Greek city at that time, a very important city.
But the dates are uncertain. Nobody knows for sure from when to when he was
Bishop of Antioch.

#### Peter in Rome and His Martyrdom

According to Eusebius, Peter first visited Rome under the Emperor Claudius;
that is the late 40s, early 50s. Perhaps—sheer question mark, nobody knows—
between Antioch and Rome, he visited the churches that he addresses at the
beginning of 1 Peter: "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers
dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia." So maybe in
between Antioch and Rome, Peter visited the churches of Asia Minor, what today
is Turkey.

Peter was certainly back in Rome at the end of his life, and he was martyred in
Rome under the Emperor Nero in AD 64 or 67. I do not know what the latest state
of that scholarly dispute is, but apparently, those are the alternate dates for
the martyrdom of Peter. He was crucified by his own request upside down. He said,
"I am not fit to be crucified like my Lord." So he asked them to crucify him
upside down, which they did. We see pictures of Peter crucified upside down.
He was crucified, whereas Paul had his head cut off. Why? Paul was a Roman
citizen, so he had the privilege of having his head cut off instead of being
crucified. Crucifixion was sort of the treatment for a slave, whereas a Roman
citizen was not crucified. So Peter was on the level of a slave, so to speak.
That he was martyred in Rome is a well-known fact, much alluded to in early
Church documents. It is too obvious to be disputed really. Notably, no other
church claims the honor. If Peter had died anywhere else, wherever it was would
have obviously claimed the honor; we would have heard about it. Added to which,
it was entirely fitting that the Eternal City should be consecrated by the blood
of Peter and Paul, the princes of the apostles. That is in the hymn of the
liturgy of June the 29th. It is a handsome hymn, written in iambic pentameters.
Most of the hymns in the breviary are written in four-line verses, often iambic
tetrameters. The advantage of this shorter verse form in Latin is that you have
many long syllables. The hymn for Rome, however, is in iambic pentameter and
mentions Paul and Peter consecrating the Eternal City with their blood.

Next point: you have lists of popes and numerous Church Fathers refer to Peter
being the first Bishop of Rome. Have you looked at this in apologetics? Probably
you have. Surely, yes. Okay, I do not need to insist.

### The Significance of Rome

#### Rome as "Babylon"

1 Peter 5:13: "The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth
you; and so doth my son Mark." This letter was written in Rome. "Babylon" is a
clear reference to Rome. So 1 Peter was written in Rome.

#### Archaeological Evidence for Peter in Rome

And then there are notably the archaeological excavations. In the last few years,
there was a sensational discovery. The present St. Peter's Basilica in the
Vatican was built over a significant period. Michelangelo, who famously painted
the Sistine Chapel and designed the dome, was active in the early to mid-1500s.
The construction spanned from the late 1400s, with consecration perhaps as late
as the 1620s. Before that, there had been other churches. Who built the first
large church on that spot? The Emperor Constantine. Because that is when the
empire converted, and he, to honor Peter, built this big church in a very
unsuitable spot—not central Rome at all, and marshy land, I think. There was a
kind of stadium or hippodrome in the area. In any case, he built this church over
the spot of Peter's martyrdom and the spot of Peter's bones. That is what
everybody used to say. There were some edifices there before Constantine, which
you would expect Christians would have put over the site.

In recent years, within the last 10 years or so, an Italian woman, a doctoress,
was in charge of excavating right down there in the middle, in the heart of it.
And they found astonishing evidence that it really is Peter's bones. They found
what really does look like Peter's own bones right there. I forget exactly what
makes them say with such certainty that it is Peter's own bones. There was a
report about a strange amount of bones, and suddenly two legs appeared below,
suggesting how he was reburied by Constantine. It caused quite a stir in Rome
only five, six, seven years ago. The stir was because this was proof that Church
tradition was right, Catholic tradition was right. When the modernists try to
discredit all of these old traditions, especially that Peter's bones are there,
to validate the direct connection with the apostle, the direct founding of the
Roman Church, they try to cast doubt upon it. And she, the doctoress, was a
persona non grata in Rome precisely because she was proving, in the teeth of all
these modernists, that what the old Church says is absolutely true. I think
*30 Days* or *Inside the Vatican* was writing about it. It was the physical
evidence right there.

I know that when Father Rudy Goyti and Father Escarra took a group of seminarians
to Rome some years ago, Father Duschlau wanted them to visit the excavation.
It is very interesting. Of course, as you can expect, the tomb of Peter himself,
or the bones of Peter himself, or the grave of Peter himself, will have been
encircled and then encircled again, much like the attempts to contain the
Chernobyl reactor—a clumsy comparison. But for some reason, in recent years,
they have been digging in there and found, for experts, complete evidence that it
is Peter's own bones still there, which is what you might expect. Christians in
any age would not easily have allowed it all to be disturbed. The modernists
have discredited it without daring to go in there and try and destroy it. It
would be a little risky fooling around with the bones of Saint Peter. Imagine
going up to the pearly gates and having to face him!

There are also inscriptions in the catacombs. There is one printed in this little
manual on a grave in the catacombs: "Petri et Pauli, orati pro Victore" – Peter
and Paul, pray for Victor. Or "Pauli et Petri, petite pro Victore." So that is a
section that has been very much updated in recent years, and it is always the
same: archaeological evidence confirms ancient tradition of the Church.

### Canonicity and Authenticity of 1 Peter

The canonicity of 1 Peter was never questioned. As mentioned, it assumes it.
The authenticity: is 1 Peter really by Peter?

#### External Evidence

1 Peter is quoted from very early on by Church authors such as Saint Clement of
Rome, who wrote his famous epistle to the Corinthians around AD 95, and Polycarp,
a little later. From very early on, the epistle is explicitly attributed to Peter
by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen. Another external
reference is 2 Peter 3:1: "Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly
beloved, in which I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind."

#### Internal Evidence

The internal evidence, working from inside the epistle itself, indicates that the
author was indeed Peter. 1 Peter 1:1 simply says, "Peter, an apostle of Jesus
Christ." As there were not two apostles named Peter with such prominence, this
clearly states it is him. Then there is also "my beloved Mark," which we saw a
few moments ago at the end of the epistle. Chapter 5, verse 13: "The church that
is in Babylon saluteth you, and so doth my son Mark." It is well-known that Mark
was very close to Peter. So Mark was in Rome with Peter at this time.
In 1 Peter 5:12, Sylvanus is mentioned. Sylvanus is a prominent figure in the
early Church (compare Acts 15:22).

Briefly, 1 Peter 5:1: "The ancients therefore that are among you I beseech, who
am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ." Again, that
might be fraudulent, but there are not all that many who were actually witnesses
to the sufferings of Christ, a witness of the Passion. And the author says he is
also a Church leader. So the author of the epistle is apparently a leader of the
Church and a witness of the Passion of Christ. There are not all that many people
that it could be.

There are, again, throughout the text of 1 Peter, over 50 texts recalling
passages from the Gospels. Fifty-four texts somebody has counted. The Gospel of
Mark is supposed to have been taken from the lips of Peter; Mark wrote down
Peter's own account of the life and death of our Lord. And lastly, there is a
marked similarity between 1 Peter and the speech of Peter in Acts 15. That is
an argument from content, an internal argument.
