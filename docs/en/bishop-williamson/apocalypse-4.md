Bishop Williamson deciphers the heavenly worship and Christ's redemptive sacrifice
as depicted in Revelation's vision of the throne room and the sealed book.

# Apocalypse 4 & 5: God's Throne, the Sealed Book, and the Lamb

His grace interprets Revelation 4's four living creatures as evangelists embodying
Christ's qualities (victory, sacrifice, humanity, divinity), their wings as virtues,
and eyes as watchfulness. He notes their "Holy, holy, holy" praise and the 24 elders
casting crowns as saints offering merits to God, the free Creator.

Bishop Williamson explains "presbuteros" (elder/priest) implies wisdom. In
Revelation 5, he says the seven-sealed book is John's prophecy, the Bible, and
Christ's humanity, its seals the mysteries of Christ's mission (Conception to Second
Coming), understood by faith. He identifies the "strong angel" with Old Testament
Doctors unable to unlock prophecy, and John's weeping with the world awaiting the
Messiah, until an elder announces the Lion of Judah.

This Lion, Bishop Williamson reveals, appears as a Lamb "standing as it were slain,"
conquering through sacrifice. He explains the Lamb's seven horns as protectors
against vice and seven eyes (seven spirits/gifts of the Holy Ghost) as discerning
virtue. When the Lamb takes the book, fulfilling prophecy, the creatures and elders
worship with harps (mortification) and vials of odors (charitable hearts offering
prayers). They sing a new song, Bishop Williamson concludes, for the Gospel's
renovation, as Christ made the redeemed a kingdom and priests to reign over evil.

## Chapter 4: The Vision of the Throne of God

### The Four Living Creatures: Symbols of Christ and the Evangelists

We begin with Revelation Chapter 4, verse seven: "The first living creature was like a
lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature, having the face,
as it were, of a man, and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying."

The lion represents Mark: Jesus Christ victorious, conquering like a lion. The calf
signifies Luke: Jesus Christ sacrificed. The man denotes Matthew: Jesus Christ human;
Matthew starts with the human genealogy of our Lord. The eagle is Saint John,
presenting the divinity of our Lord. These qualities of Christ—human, divine,
victorious, and sacrificed—must also become the qualities of the Christian. This is
the vision of the throne of God, the 24 ancients, and the four living creatures.

### The Six Wings and Innumerable Eyes

Verse eight: "And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round
about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come."

The wings are virtues lifting the soul above the present world. The six wings
represent six steps to lift the soul towards the peace of God, or the six steps up
which to climb: the senses, the imagination, the reason, the intellect, the
intelligence, and the summit of the mind. The distinction between intellect and
intelligence is not a scholastic distinction. It might be understood as the intuitive
grasp of natural things (intellect) and the intuitive grasp of supernatural things
(intelligence), though this is a personal reflection.

The text says, "and the four living creatures had, each of them, six wings." Each
Gospel contains its own ascent to God, its climb towards God.

"Round about and within, they are full of eyes." This means the saints watch over
their actions (around) and their thoughts (within). These living creatures represent
not only the four evangelists but also every Christian. The saints keep watch
within and around themselves: *Vigilate et orate*—watch and pray.

### Continual Heavenly Worship

"And they rested not day and night," meaning they are continually praising God. This
occurs day and night—in good fortune (day) and in bad (night). This is reminiscent
of Canticle of Canticles Chapter 5, Verse 2.

The cry "Holy, holy, holy" echoes Isaiah 6:2, the famous vision of Isaiah: "In the
year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated:
and his train filled the temple. Upon it stood the seraphim: the one had six wings,
and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they
covered his feet, and with two they flew. And they cried one to another, and said:
Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory." This,
of course, we have in the Mass.

### The Twenty-Four Elders and Their Crowns

Verse nine: "And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction
to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever..." Here, the
"living creatures" represent the multitude of saints giving glory to God forever
and ever.

Verse ten: "The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the
throne, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before
the throne, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour,
and power: because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and
have been created."

The crowns represent the merits of their works, which they lay or cast at the feet
of God.

### God's Creation: A Free Choice

"Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power: because
thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been created."
Notice the phrase at the end of chapter 4, "for thy will they were, and have been
created." This signifies that God created by choice and not by necessity. Nothing
forces God's will; creation is a free choice of God. To say He created by force or
necessity would certainly be an error, though perhaps not formally a heresy.

## Question and Answer: The Meaning of "Presbuteros"

A question was asked about the Greek word *presbuteros*.
Bishop Williamson: *Presbuteros*. *Presbus* is old in Greek. *Presbuteros* is the
comparative, meaning "older," so it simply means an elder. The word is transferred
to "priest" because priests are supposed to be old by their premature wisdom, even
if they are young. A priest is meant to behave seriously and in a fashion befitting
someone of more years than he actually has—that's the theory.

From *presbuteros* you get *Priester* in German, *prêtre* in French, and "priest"
in English. In Latin, Italian, and Spanish, they use *sacerdos*. But in many
languages, the term for priest comes from *presbuteros* originally. So, it
originally meant an elder, and then it took on the technical meaning of somebody
ordained.

Are there any other questions?

## Chapter 5: The Vision of the Lamb and the Seals

That concludes the vision of the throne of God. We come now to Chapter 5, to the
vision of the Lamb before the throne of God: the Lamb and the seals (S-E-A-L-S),
not the aquatic mammals.

Chapters 6 and 7 will cover the opening of the seals. Chapter 5 begins: "'And I
saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and
without, sealed with seven seals.'"

Verse two: "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy
to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?"
Verse three: "And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the
earth, to open the book, nor to look on it."
Verse four: "And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor
to see it."

### The Sealed Book: Literal and Allegorical Meanings

"'And I saw on the right of one sitting on the throne, a book.' This book has both
literal and allegorical meanings. Literally, it is John's prophecy of the seven
seals. It is also the Bible, 'written within and without,' signifying its inner
spiritual sense and its outer literal sense. For instance, the outer, literal sense
of Abraham's two sons concerns Isaac (child of the freewoman) and Ishmael (child of
the slave woman). The inner, spiritual meaning can refer to the Gentiles and the
Jews, or the Church and the Synagogue. Antioch was known for focusing on the
outward, literal sense, while Alexandria was more famous for its grasp of the
inward, spiritual sense."

### The Seven Seals: Mysteries of Christ's Mission

The book is "sealed with seven seals." These seven seals represent the seven
mysteries of Christ's redeeming mission:
1.  His Conception (March 25th)
2.  His Birth (December 25th)
3.  His Passion and Death
4.  His Descent into Hell
5.  His Resurrection
6.  His Ascension into Heaven
7.  His Second Coming to judge the living and the dead.

These mysteries are sealed to all eyes except those of faith. A disbeliever cannot
understand how the life of our Lord is the key to creation or the meaning of life.
These seven seals are closed to all except the eyes of faith.

Allegorically, the book represents the humanity of Christ, "in whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (likely referring to Colossians 2:3). This
humanity, like the book "written without and within," has an obvious outer sense
and a deep inner sense. The obvious sense is love; anyone can see He must have
loved to die for us. The deep sense is the full knowledge of the Sacred Heart, the
profound depth of that love, which is contained within. Saint Thomas Aquinas said
he learned more by contemplating the cross than from all the learned books he
read. Thus, allegorically, the book is Christ's humanity, with its obvious and
deep senses, the latter closed to disbelieving eyes.

### The Strong Angel and the Unopened Book

Verse two: "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy
to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?" This strong angel represents the
Doctors of the Old Testament, expressing their frustration. They could not read the
inner meaning because they did not yet know Christ. These Doctors were strong in
patience, awaiting the Messiah. They knew the mysterious prophecies about Him but,
looking forward, could not understand them as clearly as we can looking back.

They effectively cried out, "Who can fulfill these promises? Who is worthy to open
the book and break its seals? Who is worthy to offer the sacrifice?" (referencing
prophecies like Malachi's regarding sacrifice). John sees this great angel
symbolizing the patient, wise, but as-yet unenlightened Doctors of the Old
Testament.

They ask, "Who is worthy to open the book? Who will reveal these Old Testament
secrets? Who will offer the foreseen sacrifice?" Christ would first open and
fulfill these mysteries. He would reveal them by fulfilling them, and then He
would unseal their meaning.

It's noteworthy that the text says "open the book and to loose the seals thereof."
One might expect the seals to be loosed before the book is opened. However, this
order reflects Christ's actions: He first lived (fulfilled) the mysteries, and then
He opened up (unsealed) their meaning.

Verse three: "And no man was able, neither in Heaven, nor on Earth, nor under the
Earth, to open the book, nor to look on it." For the duration of the Old
Testament, it was a closed book. No one, not even the Blessed Virgin Mary, could
fully grasp the mystery. For example, when she found Jesus in the Temple, she
asked, "Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee
sorrowing." And the Gospel says, "And they understood not the word that he spoke
unto them," when He replied, "Did you not know, that I must be about my father's
business?" (Luke 2:48-50). So, even she did not fully understand at that time.

Verse four: "And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor
to see it." John weeps for the unhappiness of the world awaiting the Messiah. As
Our Lord said (Luke 10:24): "For I say to you, that many prophets and kings have
desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them; and to hear the
things that you hear, and have not heard them." John's tears reflect this longing.

### The Lion of Judah, The Slain Lamb

Then, "one of the elders said to me: Weep not; behold the lion of the tribe of
Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven
seals thereof." An elder, representing the Old Testament, consoles John with an Old
Testament consolation: the Messiah will come. He will snatch mankind as His prey,
like a lion. This is similar to Isaiah 31:4: "For thus saith the Lord to me: Like
as the lion roareth, and the lion's whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of
shepherds shall come against him, he will not fear their voice, nor be afraid of
their multitude: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount Sion, and
upon the hill thereof."

This verse can signify the Messiah coming to snatch mankind from the devil,
unafraid and unshakeable. The elder assures John that the Lion of the tribe of
Judah, the root of David, has conquered and will open the book and its seven seals.

Verse six: "And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four
living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were
slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent
forth into all the earth."
So, John is told a lion will come, but he sees a lamb. The conquering lion arrives
and turns out to be a lamb, a bleeding lamb. Jesus Christ conquers by His
gentleness, like the lamb before its shearers described by Isaiah. The lamb is
"standing as it were slain"—a striking image.

The lamb is "standing," signifying activity; He is not passive. "As it were slain"
means He conquers by His death; His death was His most active deed. He is standing
as though slain because Christ remained the master of death. He entered into death
by His own choice and raised Himself from it. As He said in John 10:18, "No man
taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself." Christ was never overpowered
by His enemies in a way He could not have prevented.

The Lamb has "seven horns and seven eyes." A horn always symbolizes strength (like a
bull's horns). The seven horns are protectors of the soul against the seven capital
vices. The "seven eyes... which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all
the earth" are the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. These gifts were earned for the
world by the death of the Lamb. They protect the soul against vices (acting as
horns) and, as eyes, discern for the soul the path to the seven virtues. Thus,
they are defensive as horns and discerning (or "offensive" in guiding action) as
eyes. It would require a true artist to depict a Lamb standing as though slain,
with seven horns and seven eyes, without it appearing bizarre.

### The Lamb Takes the Book

Verse seven: "And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat
on the throne." The Lamb came—*et incarnatus est*—He took flesh. The Book of Seven
Seals represents the mystery of Our Lord's life before His coming. It was a sealed
book, of which the Old Testament Doctors had only fragments, unable to piece it all
together. Then the Lamb comes, and these mysteries are revealed in dazzling light
for those with eyes of faith to see.

The Pharisees, however, remained blind, seeing only a Nazarene carpenter. But
those with faith, like the man born blind in John Chapter 9, can see. When Jesus
cured him and asked, "Dost thou believe in the Son of God?" the man replied, "Who
is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?" Jesus said, "Thou hast both seen him; and
it is he that talketh with thee." And he said: "I believe, Lord. And falling down,
he adored him." Jesus then said, "For judgment I am come into this world; that
they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind." When the Pharisees
asked if they too were blind, Jesus told them, "If you were blind, you should not
have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth" (John 9:35-41). This
illustrates how Our Lord Himself revealed and opened these mysteries, seen by the
formerly blind and unseen by those who claimed to see.

The Lamb took the book from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. "And when
he had opened the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty ancients
fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full
of odours, which are the prayers of saints" (Revelation 5:8). Incense often
symbolizes prayer ascending to the Lord. Just as gold can represent charity,
incense often represents prayer.

### Worship with Harps and Golden Vials

When Christ opened the book, He fulfilled all the sealed prophecies by living the
redemptive mysteries. His 33 years of life opened the book. Upon this, the four
living creatures and 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, "having every one of
them harps, and golden vials."

The harp symbolizes mortification. Its strings, when stretched taut and struck,
produce harmonious sound. Similarly, the soul stretched taut by mortification and
struck by penance gives forth spiritual music, unlike the slack, lazy soul.

The "golden vials full of odours" represent hearts full of charity (gold) pouring
forth the perfume of prayer (odors/incense). St. John himself explains this:
"which are the prayers of saints." When St. John explains one detail like this, or
earlier when he identified the candlesticks as churches and stars as bishops, it
implies that all other details in his visions also have specific meanings that we
must seek to understand.

### The New Song of Redemption

The vials are "full of odours, which are the prayers of saints." Prayer and
penance (or mortification) are the two instruments of spiritual advancement. The
24 elders, with their harps and vials, fall before the Lamb.

"And they sang a new canticle, saying: Worthy art thou, O Lord, to take the book,
and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God,
in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation. And hast
made us to our God a kingdom and priests; and we shall reign on the earth"
(Revelation 5:9-10).

These singers are the just from both the Old Testament (redeemed by anticipation of
Christ's merits) and the New Testament (redeemed by explicit faith in Christ).

They sang a "new canticle," a song of the world's renovation by the Gospel. While
great kings and prophets of the Old Testament desired to see and hear these things,
the full revelation was closed to them. Now, the mysteries of Christ, once
concealed from figures like King David and King Solomon, are revealed even to the
common person. The redemption truly was something new, thus inspiring a "new song."

The Lamb is "worthy... to take the book" because of His extraordinary innocence,
His total sinlessness. He was "slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood,
out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation."

Verse 10 continues: "And hast made us to our God a kingdom..." This refers to a
kingdom of grace and glory. The Kingdom of God can mean the soul in grace, the
Catholic Church, or Heaven—wherever God is king. Christ is the king of this
spiritual, not earthly, kingdom.

The verse also says, "and priests." This refers not to the ministerial priesthood
but to the priesthood of the faithful, the priesthood of the laity. In this sense,
the laity are priests as offerers of internal sacrifices from their hearts. It is
the internal priesthood of the heart, as opposed to the external, anointed
priesthood. So, "Thou hast made us to our God a kingdom and internal priests."

"And we shall reign on the earth" means we shall dominate the world, the flesh, and
the devil. This is absolutely true in Heaven and, for the Catholic Church, true on
earth in its spiritual battle.
