Transcript of a talk by Fr. Hesse on the Prophecy of La Salette.

# Fr. Hesse: La Salette Prophecy Predicting Two Worm-Ridden Popes

In this talk, Fr. Hesse reveals a censored line from the La Salette prophecy that speaks of "deux papes vermélins" (two worm-ridden popes) in the 20th century, information he received through his connection with Malachi Martin. 

He excludes John Paul I from consideration but speculates the prophecy refers to Paul VI and John Paul II, while noting the church has declined rather than improved. Fr. Hesse connects this suppressed prophecy to the broader crisis since Vatican II, argues the Third Secret of Fatima must address the post-conciliar faith crisis, and maintains that Russia's consecration to the Immaculate Heart remains unfulfilled despite claims to the contrary.

## Discussion on Malachi Martin and La Salette



**Interviewer:** Father, uh, we had a discussion on the way back today, and you brought something up I think that the public should know. Uh, we spoke about Malachi Martin.

**Father Hesse:** (clears throat) He was a friend of mine. Yes. (coughs) And I certainly worked with him also. Um, we were going to do a video, uh, because he felt that the, the real terms of La Salette were never given.

**Interviewer:** True. And you indicated something to me. Can we expound on it just a little bit? I know one line, but more than that.

**Father Hesse:** I know there is one line in The Message of La Salette, and, uh, I have, uh, the con- confirmation about that by a telephone. It might have been Malachi Martin, you see, who told me that, because we actually had several talks on the telephone. And, uh, there's one line, one line that I know of in The Message of La Salette that has been censored universally. I cannot in good conscious say who was the one who censored it. I cannot say it was the pope or the cardinals. I believe it, it, it was, uh, uh, a pope. And, and again, I, uh, do not know which one. So, let's leave that question. The line that was censored was that, uh, Our Lady said that in the, in the, the, the coming century, or the 20th century, that I don't remember. I remember literally the quotation. "There will be" (French). Two worm-ridden popes. (French). You speak French? (French). Ah, bien. (French). (French). Ah. Two worm-ridden popes.



### Identifying the "Two Worm-Ridden Popes"



**Father Hesse:** Uh, your next question should be, who were those two worm-ridden popes? (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) We have such a great choice. (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) Um, I, I positively, positively in all justice, I positively exclude John Paul I. Positively. One of my best friends in all the 15 years that I spent in Rome was Cardinal Pericle Felici, who was one of the closest friends that Albino Luciani, John Paul I, ever had. John Paul I was, uh, certainly not an orthodox Catholic, no way. Uh, John Paul I, uh, made quite a few statements, uh, including a very interesting, uh, fictional correspondence with a Satanist author of the 19th century, which, uh, is quite a puzzlement to those who know that man. Uh, I'm talking about Bossuet. Um, but, uh, John Paul II is certainly not what you would call, uh, a (French), a worm-ridden pope, because when you study the, the, the history of the church, and I'm not talking again about that poor, poor, poor Pope Liberius, who was always used as the, the scapegoat for all, uh, accusations against the church. I'm talking about people like, uh, the above-mentioned Paul IV, who was a paranoid maniac. When you go into the, the close history of Pope Paul IV, the way he treated cardinals. Like, he had them arrested without explaining to them why they were arrested. He would call, uh, an English cardinal... This is a fact. He would call an English cardinal into, uh, his audience. It means that English cardinal was expecting to face the pope and say, "Hi, Your Saint- Your Holiness." And instead, uh, two doors were opened. He was let into a huge hall. There the English cardinal stood and didn't know what to do. Bang, the door shut behind him. Another two doors opened, two Swiss guards arrived and arrested him. He asks, "What's the matter? What's happening to me?" "Uh, we don't know, we've just been ordered to arrest you." The guy was in prison until Paul IV... The guy, the cardinal. The cardinal was in prison until Paul IV died. So we've had quite a few interesting specimen of the human race, uh, on the papal throne. And we have had Alexander VI. Alexander VI not only, which is something understandable to every man in the world, not only had children, but Alexander VI had children while he was pope. Worse than that, he abused his papal authority to legitimize his daughter, Lucretia. This is, I think the, by far, by far the worst. Hilaire Belloc says that the very moment that Alexander VI legitimized his physical daughter, he was, uh, uh, ridiculing the priesthood. Celibacy is not of the essence of priesthood, but it's intimately connected with priesthood. And he ridiculed this by legitimating his own daughter. So we have had quite a few interesting characters in the papacy, and I don't see a reason why Our Lady would bother to call somebody like, uh, Luciani, Albino Luciani, John Paul I, a (French).



Now (clears throat), if we go into the sedevacantist theory, which is again, I say, a very daring theory, because we are the ones who have the proof, who have to have the proof for it and not the pope. See, in the church you're not allowed to, uh, to utter a suspicion unless you have at least some, uh, high probability or proof, and yet there is hundreds of people running around, especially in this country, who say that we haven't had a pope, and then they can't even decide since when we haven't had a... I've, I've, I've... I received a letter, uh, a couple of years ago that told me that Pius X was not a pope. Oh. He was the anti-pope because he reformed Debrary.So, well, (paper rustles) probably the next time I'm gonna hear that Pope Linus was not a pope and Peter was the first and last pope. Uh, see, these are... It's all absurd, because you have to have definite proof. Did Hillary Clinton, uh, cease to be president when she betrayed the Constitution? No. (laughs) (laughs) So, uh, (clears throat) the same thing is true here. Let's but, but for argument's sake, let's say we have not had a pope since 1958. Who were the 2 Papas Vermelins? Pius XI with his terrible mistake of instituting the Catholic action and Pius XII with changing Holy Week? Hey, you see? There you are. That's one of the things that the Society of St. Pius X absolutely hates about Father Hess, that I dare to even utter the most remote criticism about Pope Pius XII. Uh, well, uh, (laughs) as if he was untouchable. Uh, (laughs) he's not. (laughs) Alexander VI was as much pope as Pius XII, and he was not untouchable. Uh, these, uh, you, you, you shouldn't confuse dogma with judgment. And, uh, so who are the, the 2 Papas Vermelins? Is it true what they say, that in 1986 with Assisi, uh, John Paul II ceased to be pope, so the, the two Papas Vermelins would either be John Paul II and Paul VI, or Paul VI and John XXIII, or John XXIII and Pius XII, or Pius XII and Pius XI? Hey, wait a second. Our Lady said there's going to be two Papas Vermelins, two worm-ridden popes. My personal guess, don't say Father Hess dogmatically pronounces that this is such. My personal educated guess, educated, but guess, is that the two Papas Vermelins were Paul VI and John Paul II. But let's wait for the next one. (laughs) (laughs) I think we're in for a treat. (laughs)



## Discussion on the State of the Church and Fatima



**Interviewer:** Yes. You think in the year that we met, this year, that the church has improved or gone down?

**Father Hesse:** Gone down. Gone down, because, uh, I think that if you remember our last encounter last year, when we talked about the fourth secret of Fatima, that's not exactly what you call, uh, a spiritual progress. When the s- when the church... Or let's puts, put it this way. Not the church of Christ, not the Catholic Church, but when these people in Rome start to lie about things like the Secret of Fatima, and they did lie, most definitely, as was proven in the Fatima Crusader, especially in the article by, uh, an- Andre, Andy Suzanek. If they start to lie about even things like that, then I can't call that spiritual progress. So we've gone down. Humanly speaking, mind you. The Holy Spirit, when I say humanly speaking, I cannot tell the Holy Spirit what to do. I cannot tell Christ what to do. Humanly speaking, we are finished.



**Interviewer:** Do you think that Our Lady's prophecy is coming true now at Fatima? What prophecy?

**Father Hesse:** Well, we've heard, we've heard that Our Lady at Fatima told, uh, Lucia, Sister Lucia... Yeah. ... that, that the pope was supposed to consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart, and all the bishops together.

**Interviewer:** Correct. That has been done and it has not been done.

**Father Hesse:** No, it has not been done in any way.

**Interviewer:** Well, whoever you wanna listen to, it has been done and it hasn't been done.

**Father Hesse:** Ah, listen to Sister Lucia.

**Interviewer:** You contend, you contend that it has not been done?

**Father Hesse:** Absolutely not. Fatima Crusader proves that too.

**Interviewer:** Well, I, I... So you're saying to me Sister Lucia said that it, it has not been done?

**Father Hesse:** Correct. And other people say she said- That was a hoaxed interview. I think it was in 1991, and it has been proven a hoax.



**Interviewer:** You think it's suspicious, Father, there was a man, a priest who knew the message of Fatima, and it was Father Melachi Martin. Is that correct?

**Father Hesse:** Yes, yes, I knew him.

**Interviewer:** Did you like him?

**Father Hesse:** Yeah.

**Interviewer:** Do you... It's suspicious that he, they didn't come out with that until he died?

**Father Hesse:** Certainly it's suspicious. Now, that's all I can say. I have no detailed information on, on the decision for the exact moment of publication. It is certainly suspicious. Uh, I'm used to seeing suspicious things coming out of the Vatican. Even the meat they sell is suspicious. (laughs) I should know, I've been chopped and trapped in there.



**Interviewer:** Well, Father, you have not seen the secret.

**Father Hesse:** No.

**Interviewer:** Do you know people who have seen it?

**Father Hesse:** I do not personally know anyone who has seen it, really seen it.

**Interviewer:** In the second order, then, you know some in the first order who has, knew someone who did see it?

**Father Hesse:** In the second order, yes. Yes.

**Interviewer:** So could you sort of maybe clarify what you think... Not clarify, but tell us what you think the secret could have been.

**Father Hesse:** It's, uh, log- logically conclusive. There is no, uh, alternative. It has to be one thing. Our Lady knew. Now, you have to understand, Our Lady does not know the future. There is only Father, Son, and Holy Spirit who know the future, right?

**Interviewer:** Yes.

**Father Hesse:** So Our Lady does not know the future unless she's told. Our Lady knew exactly when first, the First World War would finish. She knew exactly under which pope, and she named him, Pius XI, the Second World War would break out. She knew exactly that Russia would spread her errors. John XXIII was a great help in that point. She knew exactly that, uh, the pope won't consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart because she said, "Eventually the pope is going to do it, but it will be late."She also knew that Russia was going to be the instrument of chastisement and that entire na- nations would be annihilated, which is exactly what the European Union, by the way, is doing now. And she knew nothing about Vatican II? Who's gonna believe that? She knew about those, uh, 55 or 60 million people that died in World War II, and she knew nothing about one billion Catholics being deprived of the truth by what is going on since Vatican II? She didn't know about that? That is impossible. It's not improbable, it's impossible. She was told the future in order to tell us at Fatima. She was told the future beyond 1965, beyond the 20th century, as a matter of fact, because she said, "Russia will be consecrated to the, to my immaculate heart, but it will be late. It hasn't been done yet." So, she referred to an event that is most definitely going to take place in the 21st century. And then she knew nothing about Vatican II, the most revolutionary of all councils, if, if it was a council, which I deny? She didn't know anything about that. That is perfectly impossible. The Third Secret of Fatima must, is bound to contain the crisis of the faith following Vatican II, therefore it must in some way mention Vatican II. There is no way around that.



**Interviewer:** La Salette did that, am I correct, Father?

**Father Hesse:** In a certain sense, yes, indirectly. Uh, La Salette spoke about, uh, uh, suspicious popes. Well, actually, La Salette, uh, used, used the term (foreign language)　. (foreign language)　(00:01:29), two worm-ridden popes.

**Interviewer:** Say, say that again?

**Father Hesse:** Worm-ridden popes.

**Interviewer:** Worm-ridden popes?

**Father Hesse:** Worm-ridden popes. (foreign language)　(00:01:39). Who wants to look it up in the dictionary? (laughs) (foreign language)　.
