Bishop Williamson explicates the symbolism of the New Jerusalem from Revelation 21, 
contrasting its divine truth with contemporary political deceptions and the 
'liberal mind.'

# Apocalypse 21: Heavenly Jerusalem and Illusions of Modernity

Bishop Williamson begins his commentary on Revelation 21, explaining the splendors 
of the heavenly Jerusalem. He says the angel of the cups evokes preceding 
purifications for the Church, the bride and wife of the Lamb, and that the soul 
also weds Christ. He explains that the heavenly Jerusalem is built on a high 
mountain, unlike Babylon, and uses this to launch into a critique of contemporary 
events, particularly the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which he calls a "Disneyland 
war" orchestrated by the "liberal mind" and manipulative media, potentially 
leading to a Third World War. 

Bishop Williamson then returns to the symbolism of the city: its glory, precious 
light (Christ), wall (Christ's humanity), twelve gates (Apostles), and foundations 
(Patriarchs). He explains the golden reed for measuring the city as Holy Scripture, 
and reflects on God's choice of messengers like Jeremiah and Archbishop Lefebvre 
before discussing the city's perfect, four-square dimensions.

## Introduction: Commentary on Revelation 21

(Transcript starts): Verse nine. Schmid? Yes, nine. We enter the second part of
chapter 21, the splendors of the heavenly Jerusalem. It is quite dense; the
commentary gets quite dense. The third part will be chapter 22, the first verses
of chapter 22, with an epilogue.

## The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb

All right, verse nine. Chapter 21, verse 9: "And there came one of the seven
angels who had the vials full of the seven last plagues and spoke with me saying,
'Come and I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.' And he took me up in
spirit to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem
coming down outta heaven from God, having the glory of God. And the light thereof
was like to precious stone as to the jasper stone, even as crystal."

An angel of the cups—we usually said cups—is referring back to chapter 16,
principally. An angel of the cups evokes the preceding purifications by which the
Church has had to attain her triumphant state. This angel says, "Come and I will
show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb." "Come" equals quit earthly things, rise
to heavenly things. *Sursum corda*. "And I will show thee the bride, the wife of
the Lamb." The Church is engaged to Christ in this life and married to Him in the
next: the bride and the wife. Bride in this life, wife in the next. Besides the
Church, it is also the soul. The soul which weds Christ is both virginal spouse
and fruitful wife—two things not normally combinable.

## The Heavenly Jerusalem and Earthly Babylon

Verse 10: "And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain. He showed me
the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
"And he took me up in spirit on a great and high mountain." The heavenly Jerusalem
is built on a high mountain, unlike Babylon, which is built on rivers, the Tigris
and the Euphrates. Psalm 136:1, Babylon is built on rivers. That is the psalm
about dashing the children against the stones, is it not? Psalm 136:1: "By the
rivers of Babylon, we sat there and wept when we remembered Sion. Blessed he who
will take hold of their little children and smash them on the rock."
Those are verses which are now considered optional by some, or are even missing
from newer versions because they are deemed too nasty.

## Digression: The "Liberal Mind" and the War in Yugoslavia

Apparently, Clinton is now already offering stacks of money to rebuild Yugoslavia.
Absolutely mad. I heard the reaction of the Serbs: they are holding huge open-air
rock concerts to celebrate the fact that they are getting bombed. They are all
getting out in the open, old and young, and holding rock concerts to keep up their
spirits from being bombed, I guess. So instead of getting bombed, they get stoned.
The world is completely mad.

These liberals, they think they are nice guys, sweet guys, and say, "We will help
you to rebuild it all." In the meantime, they go on smashing it to pieces every
day. The liberals cannot bear you to disagree with them. They are so sacrosanct,
convinced they are right, but they will not tolerate you disagreeing with them.
The moment Milošević would bow down and agree, then everything would be sweet and
nice. "Oh, what was all this bombing about? Well, that was just..." Incredible.
Absolutely incredible. To understand the liberal mind, do not try too hard; you
will fall into it. Yet it is absolutely everywhere.

### Media Manipulation and the "Disneyland War"

Disneyland. Disneyland war. How does Disneyland make war? Watch. They think they
are going to win this by air bombardment alone. Apparently, experts in NATO said,
"You cannot win this war by just an air bombardment." But that is how they are
behaving. It is classic; sooner or later, you have to send in the soldiers at
ground level if you want to conquer, because you cannot do it just with bombs.
Even in Iraq, they did the same thing. They flew daily many more planes to bomb
Iraq before they finally attacked with the soldiers. Sooner or later, you have to.
If you want to conquer, you have got to attack with the soldiers, because
otherwise, they just go underground and wait.

### Historical Parallels and Warnings

I was reading somewhere that Marshal Tito, during the Second World War, organizing
the Yugoslav resistance to the Germans, gave the Nazis a terrible time trying to
subdue Yugoslavia, and they never succeeded. The Yugoslavs tied up a huge number of
German army divisions just in Yugoslavia because they could not subdue them. These
people are in their own country. It is very mountainous; they lay ambushes, they
hide, they know the land. Foreigners come in, they do not know the land. So, NATO
was warned by people who knew what they were talking about: "Look, you are not
going to win this by an air bombardment alone, and do not think of sending in
ground troops."

General MacArthur told Kennedy to get out of Vietnam. Eisenhower told Kennedy to
get out of Vietnam. Kennedy was getting out of Vietnam, and of course, he got
shot by we know who, and immediately Johnson turned it around, and they went back
into Vietnam because that is what the "we know who" wanted. You do not get into a
ground war which you cannot be sure of winning.

### The Push Towards a Third World War

But the drumbeat in the media, day after day, these pictures of poor Albanians.
What about the poor Serbs for years and years? It has been a two-way traffic. Oh no,
the media is all pushing one way, pushing towards war and towards sending in the
ground troops. When they began bombing, they said, "Oh, we are never going to send
in the ground troops." And now, steadily, "Oh, we may have to send in the ground
troops." The people are being prepared little by little, and they are going to buy
it.

Around the world, they will be airborne. Kevin Ryan says in the little local school
there, there is lots of propaganda about the draft. Somebody wants the Third World
War. It is not the Russians at this point in time. It is the West. It is the
criminals that are directing the West, that control people like Clinton and Blair.
Blair is just as bad as Clinton, as far as I am concerned. His private life is a
little cleaner, but he is the same kind of idiot.

The media, and the stupid people who follow the media. The media can do what they
like with people's minds, it seems. It is very cleverly done. The rider knows his
horse. The image often in the Apocalypse for leaders to the people is like rider
to horse. The rider has to know his horse and take the horse into consideration,
but he pretty much makes the horse do what he, the rider, wants, within the limits
of the horse. So these leaders, they know how to manipulate a crowd. It is
incredible. It is terrible to watch because plenty of people think we are
definitely heading, little by little, towards the Third World War. And the Third
World War is not going to be pleasant at all.

They were warned, "You will never do this by air bombardment alone." But that was
the pretense, and so they are still bombing, bombing, bombing. It is incredible.
And then they are pretending that they are doing nothing, only... by what right?
Who do they think they are? It is ridiculous, completely ridiculous. You had tin
pot dictators all over Africa; there was tremendous slaughter. Any question of
bombing them? No. They are bombing the Balkans. Somebody wants to start a third
world war. There is a terrible punishment coming, a terrible punishment, and it is
fully deserved, I am afraid, fully deserved.

## Return to Revelation: The Glory of Humility

So, Babylon is built on the rivers. Psalm 136:1: "By the rivers of Babylon, we sat
and we wept when we remembered Zion." The mountain, in this case, is Christ's
humanity on which the Church is built. The great and high mountain is the humanity
of Christ on which the Church is built.
"And he showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God."
Coming down. The glory of humility descending, instead of the darkness of pride
climbing, like Lucifer. The glory of humility descending, not the darkness of
pride climbing.

## Symbolism of the Precious Stone

Verse 11. "Having the glory of God." Glory of humility descending. "And the light
thereof was like to a precious stone." The precious stone is Christ. Invincibly
firm, and that is why he is like a stone, and infinitely precious by his virtues.
The jasper is a beautiful green stone, eternal springtime. *Virens lapis,
aeternum ver.*

## Further Critique of Modern Warfare and Deception

These bombs smashing children to pieces against the rocks, you know? And then they
pretend people are not getting hurt. They have got it so fixed up in their minds
that this is really peace. It is straight out of George Orwell, 1984. War is
peace. There is no declaration of war in Congress, no asking Congress for
permission to go to war, because this is not war. This is just exerting a little
pressure on a nasty man. Get real. They are completely unreal, these people.

And it is obviously not only Clinton. It could not possibly be only him. There is a
whole clack of them in Washington, a whole clack of foreign policy makers and
soldiers who go along with it. They have got the idea that the United States can
drop bombs anywhere in the world to straighten things out. Notice they drop bombs,
bombs, bombs, in the hope that they will not have to expose any of their own
soldiers. Imagine the frustration of the people on the receiving end, who are
getting smashed to pieces, and there is nobody and nothing they can hit back at.
What a way to make war.

But sooner or later, they will have to go in, and then the Serbs are waiting for
them, waiting for the ground troops to come in. Then we are going to start seeing
the body bags. Interesting to see what the liberals will do with the body bags. In
Vietnam, the liberals did not want the war. Now, the very same people that did not
want war in Vietnam want this crazy war. The war in Vietnam was sensible against
communism. This war has no sense at all, except for globalists. How can they
destroy one sensible war and create this one? Because in the one case, it is a
fight against communism, which the liberals do not want to fight. But the liberals
do want globalism, and NATO smashing Yugoslavia is globalism. So that is why they
did not want that war, but they do want this war. And yet they pretend that this
is not a war; it is just dropping a lot of bombs.

When they send in those ground troops, as they will most likely have to unless more
sensible counsels prevail, when they start getting killed, I will bet you the media
will keep completely quiet about the body bags coming home. Silence. Oh, they are
rats, these people. It is all Christ and the Antichrist. That is what it is. In
Vietnam, communism is the Antichrist, and therefore to fight communism... "He that
is not against you is for you." So America was on the side of Christ as long as it
was fighting communism. So the liberals were against. Now that America is on the
side of the Antichrist, the liberals have prevailed, and now the liberals are all
for it. "But it is against your principles to fight war." "That is nuts. We are not
fighting war. This is not war. This is just dropping bombs." Imagine these minds.
Washington and London, make no mistake. Apparently, Italy is now beginning to
complain of acting as an aircraft carrier, just a jumping-off place for all the
bombs. Good for the Italians, say I. Italy and France did not want much to do with
the last war, and they were quite right. People accused the French of not having
opposed the Nazis with reason. To oppose the Nazis was to help communism. It was a
fight between two thieves. Let them get on with it. Hitler wanted to fight the
communists. But the liberals are crusading for this war. Incredible.

## The Wall and Gates of the Holy City

All right. This is considerably more sane. Jasper is the beautiful green stone of
eternal springtime. The crystal is the clear pure conscience of the elect.

Verse 12. "And it had a wall great and high, having twelve gates and in the gates
twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of
the children of Israel." The wall, in this case, is Christ's humanity shielding the
Church from her enemies. It is a great wall. Great by nobility, high by the
hypostatic union. You may remember the antiphon of Advent: *Urbs fortitudinis
nostrae Sion, salvator ponetur in ea murus et antemurale.* "The city of our
strength is Sion. The Savior will be placed in it as a wall and as an outer wall."
Isaiah 26:1. High by the hypostatic union.

The twelve gates are the Apostles, whose doctrine alone gives entry to the city of
God. "And in the gates, twelve angels." The twelve angels are special guardians of
the Apostles and their successors. "And names written thereon which are the names
of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel." The 12 Old Testament tribes represent
the continuity of the Old Testament with the New Testament. Putting Old Testament
names on the new Jerusalem shows the connection, the continuity between Christ's
Old Testament and His New Testament church. They both belong to Him.

## Symbolism of the Twelve Gates

Verse 13. "On the east, three gates. On the north, three gates. On the south,
three gates, and on the west, three gates." Four times three represents the three
mysteries of the redemption and the Trinity. The three is the Trinity, and the
four is the cross. So, the four sides represent a cross if you join the opposite
sides. You draw a cross in the middle of the city. The three is the Holy Trinity.
So you have the Trinity of the redemption, the essential mysteries of the Trinity
and the redemption.

North, south, east, west. Literally, the opening of the church to all men. The
church is open to all men, all four points of the compass. Figuratively, the east
is the men who lived at the beginning of the world. The west is the men who live
at the end of the world. Started in the Garden of Eden, finished in the United
States of America. The south is the Jews who were enlightened by the sunshine of
God. The north is the Gentiles who were plunged in darkness.

In the figurative sense, the three gates in each of the four walls mean that you
can come into the city, into the Church, as virgin, spouse, or widow. Those are
the three states of life of all men. All men will be in one of those three states.

In the moral sense, according to Albert the Great, the 12 gates by which there is
entry into the church are the 12 basics of preaching. By the east, to enlighten
one's listeners, you have to work out whether they are beginners, people on their
way spiritually, or perfect. The three northern gates are the three threats
hanging over man: death, judgment, and hell. The southern gates are the three
promises: forgiveness, grace, glory. The three western gates are the three kinds of
sin that you have to do penance for: sins of thought, sins of word, sins of action.
That is a lot of detail, but that is Albert the Great, a great church doctor,
giving a moral sense for the 12 gates by which to enter the church.

## Foundations of the City: Patriarchs and Apostles

Verse 14. "And the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the 12 names of
the 12 apostles of the Lamb." The 12 foundations are the Old Testament patriarchs.
It is on those patriarchs that Christ laid the foundations of His church. Compare
Psalm 86:1: *Fundamenta eius in montibus sanctis.* "Their foundations are on the
holy mountains." *Diligit Dominus portas Sion super omnia tabernacula Iacob.
Gloriosa dicta sunt de te, civitas Dei.* That is from Friday Lauds.
The 12 Old Testament patriarchs on whom Christ laid the foundations of His church
are continuous with the 12 New Testament apostles. "The 12 names of the 12
apostles of the Lamb." And the apostles are all founded in their turn on Christ the
Lamb. Christ was the foundation of the patriarchs of the Old Testament; He is the
foundation of the apostles of the New Testament.
Ephesians 2:19-20: "Therefore, you are no longer guests and strangers, but you are
citizens of the saints and you belong to the household of God. Built upon the
foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Christ Himself being the fundamental
cornerstone." In which all the building grows up into a holy temple in God, in whom
you too are built together to form a dwelling of God in the Spirit.

## Measuring the City: Merits and Scripture

Verse 15. "And he that spoke with me had a measure of a reed of gold to measure
the city and the gates thereof and the wall."
In the Church, in the City of God, not all the saints enjoy equal glory. So, there
is a measure which gives the suitable reward to each one. The various saints have
various rewards measured according to their merits. The golden reed which measures
the merits of the saints, according to which they are rewarded, is the teachings
of Holy Scripture. "He that spoke with me," this Angel of the Cups, had as a
measure a golden reed to measure the city and its gates and the wall. The golden
reed is the teachings of Holy Scripture. The city is the masses of the people. The
gates are the prelates, the church leaders. The wall is the secular leaders, the
princes—today, you would say politicians.

### The Meaning of "The Wall"

Who told the bishops that they must be like a wall? Gregory XVI, at the end of
*Mirari Vos*, tells the bishops they are going to have to be like a wall to stand
up to Liberalism. I think it is from scripture. What prophet is told that he has
got to be like a wall? A wall of bronze, I think. Jeremiah, perhaps? The Lord tells
him he has got to be like a wall.
And who wails in modern times about the wall? John Hoffman mentioned Pink Floyd's
*The Wall*. It is his vision of modern society. All of modern society is built
like a wall, in which everybody is shut off from everybody else, divided. It is
interesting. It is a vision of a dis-society, which is true. How do people get
over this feeling of dis-society? In a sports stadium, with the wave. It is
absolutely childish, but it at least makes people feel that they belong again, that
they are together. It is an artificial society because the real society is like a
wall.

Jeremiah 1:18: "Yes, I today have given you to be a fortified city, a column of
iron, and a wall of bronze upon the whole earth. To the kings of Judah and its
princes, and to the priests, and to the people. And they will make war on you and
they will not prevail because I am with you, says the Lord, in order to free you."
Magnificent.

### God's Choice of Messengers: Jeremiah and Lefebvre

What did Jeremiah say when the Lord said, "Okay, you have got a vocation"? He said,
"Ah, ah, ah. Oh, no. Not me, Lord. I do not want to." Moses also had a similar
reaction: "Lord, I stammer. I cannot talk." The Lord chooses surprising
individuals. What is the advantage of choosing somebody like Jeremiah? The power of
the Lord is more manifested. It is going to be God that does it, because it is
absolutely not in Jeremiah himself to perform such a vocation.
Another advantage: if you put somebody who loves to "strangle all the Jews" onto it,
it would be too human. His own personality would be too prominent. Whereas if
Jeremiah is sent to do it, who does not want to do it at all, it is going to be
purely God in action. If you had met Jeremiah, you would have seen that it was not
him personally.

Just a little like Archbishop Lefebvre. He was not somebody who loved tearing up
the enemy. He was strong, but he was much more inclined to make friends with his
colleagues, his fellow bishops. He had no personal inclination to go to war and
tear them all to pieces. That is why if he stood up to them, it was clearly not his
own doing, not his own will or personality. It was God's doing. Same with Jeremiah.
If the Lord God chooses somebody who says, "Oh, no, not me," then it is not
Jeremiah's doing. It proves that it is God's doing. That is one reason why God
mysteriously chooses who He does choose.

So, the golden reed is the teachings of Holy Scripture. The city is the masses, the
gates are the prelates, and the wall is the princes, the secular authorities. The
gates are where the action is, but the gates depend upon the wall. If you have no
wall, there is no gate, or the gate has no meaning. If there is no wall, people
just walk in and out of the city how they like. If there is a wall, then people
have to deal with the gates. If you have got the secular authorities with the
church, then people have to deal with the church. Otherwise, they just go around
the church. It is an interesting comparison from some medieval commentators.

## The Dimensions of the Heavenly City

Verse 16. "And the city lieth in a four square, and the length thereof is as great
as the breadth, and he measured the city with the golden reed for 12,000 furlongs,
and the length and the height and the breadth thereof are equal."
What kind of artist would have been very good to do this? Cubists. Picasso was a
famous Cubist painter, along with Georges Braque. Picasso went through Cubism
relatively early in his career, around 1908. He was an absolutely brilliant
artist, from the area of Barcelona, Spanish. Brilliant technique, empty soul. He
had nothing to say, but he was brilliant at saying it.

So, the city, the four square, represents the four cardinal virtues. "And its
length is as great as its breadth" means that these four virtues are cultivated in
a balanced way. The four virtues are in balance.

Oh, we'll continue next week.
