Bishop Williamson deciphers the terrifying visions of the sixth trumpet in the Book of
Apocalypse, connecting ancient prophecies to modern societal ills and the eventual
appearance of Christ as the mighty angel.

# Apocalypse, The Sixth Trumpet and the Mighty Angel

The sixth angel of Apocalypse Chapter 9 signals a most difficult time, with 
Catholic tradition instructing preachers to recognize unleashed devils undermining faith. 
These demonic forces, like a flood, will kill the impenitent. 

Bishop Williamson interprets the bureaucrats, journalists and teachers as horsemen 
misleading the masses, their power rooted in societal moral decay. He states the horses' 
fiery breastplates, illusory hyacinth, and brimstone signify hardened hearts, false sanctity, and
unnatural lust, while fire, smoke, and brimstone from their mouths are plagues
of angry words, blinding passion, and impurity.

His grace laments that even those not directly slain fail to repent from
idolatry and sin, reflecting modern society, and discusses the dangers of black
magic. He warns against the crusading, deceptive passion of modern anti-Christian
forces. 

Finally, Bishop Williamson begins his exegesis of Chapter 10, identifying
the "mighty angel" as Christ, whose cloud-like flesh is quasi-immaterial, laden
with graces, and whose feet, like pillars of fire, represent his preachers.

## Apocalypse Chapter 9: The Sixth Trumpet Sounds

Where are we? Oh, yes. Verses 15 and 16 of chapter 9. Let's have a look at the English first. 
"And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet and I heard a voice from the four horns of the 
golden altar which is before the eyes of God, saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, 
'Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.' And the four angels were
loosed who were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to kill the third part of men."

### The Four Angels of the Euphrates and the Flood of Evil

Once again, the sixth angel represents the preachers battling with the Antichrist
himself in the most difficult time of all. What did we see last time? The one
voice is tradition, Catholic tradition, the voice of the Church, telling the
preachers that the devil's four angels—in this case, four devils—undermining
hell, heaven, the wrongness of sin, and the rightness of virtue will be let
loose like a deep, flooding river of passions running from Babylon down to hell,
the Euphrates down to the ocean of hell, to kill the third part of men. In this
case, it refers to those who are impenitent, not the innocents. The devils of
the passions let loose are the flood of diabolism, the flood of anti-Catholicism
let loose under the Antichrist, which will, like a muddy river, destroy
everything; a river overflowing its banks. Floods are devastating. I've never
been in one, but I know of some. Of course, you know why there were so many
floods in the Midwest shortly after Clinton came to power? Because he took all
the dykes with him to Washington.

So, the four angels that are let loose are ready to pounce the moment they get
their power. They're like devils on a leash, and they're let loose to kill the
third part of men: all those who are impenitent—neither those who are innocent,
nor those who are guilty but repented, but those who are guilty and will not
repent.

### The Army of Horsemen: The Damned Elite

"And the number of the army of horsemen was 20,000 times 10,000 and I heard
the number of them." We were saying that the horsemen are the numberless hosts
of the damned elite. You'd say today, Washington bureaucrats. The bureaucrats,
the elite that run things, and they're all damned, virtually speaking. The
journalists also, the university teachers, the school teachers, all of these
people who are supposedly elite. They are like horsemen. They're riding the
masses, teaching the masses, misleading the masses, working with the devils
against God. So, those are the cavaliers, Verse 16. There are a lot of them.
You look around today.

About what percentage lead? I think Lenin has a quote about that. He says,
"Give me... [a small number] and I will take over the country."
Tennyson Francis, there's one thing he said. Tennyson Francis could have done
it, but he wasn't thinking of working with Sir Francis. I remember a figure
of 1%. It all depends. If they're just convinced enough, it all depends on the
grade of conviction. If they're convinced enough, the greater the conviction,
the fewer you need. And today, the Catholic Church, the situation of the Church
could be thrown into reverse by quite a small number of really, really
convinced individuals, but they have to be really convinced. No half-and-half
romance will do.

So, in this case, the bureaucrats, they're numberless. And they are numberless
too. Why does the government have so many people working for it? Why do the
governments, not just in the United States, have so many people working for
them? Various reasons. One is they don't want to disagree with government
policy. If they take a paycheck from the government, you're not going to stand
up and fight the government. That's quite a bit of it. What's another major
reason? It's the old story, *Dona Securitas*. If men won't govern themselves
from inside, they'll have to be governed from outside. So the wilder men
become, the more uncontrolled men become, the less religion they have, the more
government they must have. And then people react and say, "Oh, you've got to
deregulate." So you deregulate, and then what happens if you do deregulate?
Naughty men pick up the ball and run with it, and then you have to regulate
again to stop them.

In other words, it goes back to what the founding fathers said: "You can't
have a free society unless the people are self-controlled." If the people are
not self-controlled, they'll have to be government-controlled. It's as simple
as that. And Madison and Washington and Franklin all said it in one way or
another: the American style of government presupposes self-controlled and
virtuous citizens. And if you haven't got self-controlled and virtuous
citizens, there's no way that this form of government will work. And it's now
breaking down. The admiration for Clinton, who's completely un-self-controlled,
shows that's why you've got the police state and the prisons and the rest of
it, and it's inevitable. And that's what it's going to be like under the
Antichrist.

### The Vision of the Horses and Their Riders

So, the horses, verse 17: "And thus, I saw the horses in the vision and they
that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone
and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and from their mouths
proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone." This comes back to the cavaliers,
back to the horsemen.

The horses are the damned masses on which the elite ride. All of your
televidiots who go to the sports stadiums and do the wave. Poor things.
*Misereor super turbam*. Schmidt? Not misery is upon the masses. No, *misereor*.
It's the verb *misereor*, from which we get the second person singular present
imperative, *miserere nostri Domine, miserere nostri*. So *misereor* is what's
known as a deponent verb, passive in form and active in meaning, and it means...
Weber? "I pity." Yes. Therefore, *Misereor super turbam* is "I have pity on the
crowd." Our Lord says it. Matthew 9:36. "I have pity on the crowd." There we are.
Walk through an airport and think of those words. *Misereor super turbam*.
These poor people.

Back to the horsemen for a moment. Breastplates: hearts hardened against grace.
The breastplate was a metal covering of the whole chest with straps to hold it
on behind. Not much use against bullets, but against daggers and lances it
would help. So, hearts hardened against grace. Breastplates of fire: fire with
the desire to set the whole universe aflame. Crash and burn. I think it's from
rappers or heavy metal. Fiery with the desire to set the whole world on fire.
Not the fire of Our Lord, obviously, but the fire of the devil. In the ghettos
in the United States, "Burn, baby, burn," inhabited by people who have not
light skins, a politically incorrect name to use. "Burn, baby, burn."

Hyacinth blue, that's the Latin word, *hyacinthinus*. Hyacinth blue from the
illusion of their heavenly nature. They take themselves to be saints. And that's
still true today. People baptize their own sins. Who's one of the first and
greatest modern baptizers of sin? Rousseau. Absolutely. That's his hallmark:
enable you to sin while thinking you're still Christian. That's the size of it.
Hyacinth blue from the illusion of their heavenly nature. Sulfurous from the
stink of their unnatural lust. Brimstone is sulfur.

The heads of the horses were as the heads of lions. The heads of the horses
are the leaders of heresies and leaders of persecutions. They're like the heads
of lions. They are lionish because of their proud and cruel readiness to devour
everybody and everything.

"And from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone." Fire represents
words of anger, hatred, and agitation. Smoke, again—you may remember Ignatius
picked up on fire and smoke—is blinding passion without substance. Passions
which blind you, get in your eyes. You can't see anything. And you choke. You
can't breathe and you can't see. I sat through many fires. People die of the
smoke rather than of the flames. Blinding without substance. The sulfur, again,
or brimstone, is full of impurity.

### The Three Plagues and Their Effect

"And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire and
by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths."
The three plagues are fire, smoke, and brimstone: angry words, blindness, and
impure passion. A third part of men was killed. Some men hide. A second part of
men confess the faith. The third part deny Christ and perish, perish eternally.
So by these plagues of the horsemen and the horses—you just look at today's
world, and you can see that, so to speak. The damned elite and the damned
masses of today.

Verse 19: "For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.
For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they hurt."
The power in their mouth is their flattering and seductive words. "And in
their tails"—well, the tails cover over dishonorable parts. So these prophets,
these corrupters, disguise their corruption. Today, look at it. Just look at it
today. So their flattering and seductive words, and the disguising of their
corruption. Their tails are like serpents. They're as cunning as Satan. Satan,
you remember, took the form of a snake. "And have heads, and with them they
hurt." De Morien says, following doubted medieval commentators, "Having heads
means that they, the horses, have at their disposal the secular powers." It's
certainly absolutely true today. The horses have at their disposal the secular
powers by which they can do so much harm, by which they hurt. "The tails are
like serpents, and the tails have heads, and by their heads they harm." The
enemies of God have at their disposal secular power, and that's how they do so
much damage.

### The Impenitence of Mankind

Verse 20: "And the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues did
not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore
devils, and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which
neither can see nor hear nor walk. Neither did they repent from their
murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their fornication, nor from
their thefts."

The rest of mankind that was not persecuted by the Antichrist did not do
penance. The Antichrist directly hits a certain number of men. That's why we
said, of those that are persecuted, some hide, some stand up to the
persecution, confess their faith, and undoubtedly get martyred, and then the
third part denies Christ and perishes. But then there's another mass of
mankind which is not directly persecuted, which goes with the flow. And they,
though they see what's going on, though they may well suspect that it's
anti-Christian and against Christ, they don't do penance. It doesn't faze them.
They just go with the flow. Undoubtedly, the Antichrist keeps the television
sets going, so they just go on watching television. They did not do penance
from their works so as to stop adoring devils or idols of gold and silver
and bronze and stone and wood—images which can neither see nor hear nor walk.
Idols, in other words. They did not do penance from their homicides, their
sorceries, their fornication, nor from their theft. Murder, fornication,
theft. Look at it today: Clinton, all three in spades. Sorcery, Mrs. Clinton
gets into that. It looks as though he leaves that to her. She dabbles in all
kinds of occult things, as far as I know. She's interested in that kind of
thing, at least interested. Whether she's involved, she certainly wouldn't yet
let people know.

People are, for the moment, still disguising it if they're involved in black
magic, but it's more and more coming out into the open. You go into an average
bookstore today, and you will often find a section on black magic books, which
is terrible. Ignorant people can pick up these books out of curiosity and start
dabbling and getting involved. God will often set up roadblocks if somebody
starts getting involved in black magic. He will set up warnings and blocks
which you have to jump over. But if people insist, He will let them. And once
you get into black magic, it's very bad news, once you get into it deeply.

I heard an interesting tape recently by Father Brian Harrison about exorcisms.
He was in Rome by accident and got in touch with Father Gabriele Amorth.
I think somebody asked him if he wanted to attend an exorcism. Father Amorth
is Rome's sort of full-time exorcist, and he has a kind of hangar in the
suburbs of Rome, with a few heavyset guys, where he can make all the noise and
commotion they like, because an exorcism does involve commotion. Apparently, he
performs quite a lot of exorcisms. Father Harrison was able to watch. Father
Harrison is a conservative. He's a smart man, Australian, but he's not honest.
He got into a scrap with Michael Davies over religious liberty. Michael Davies
was on the right side of the debate. Father Harrison more or less admitted that
a certain book he had written to please the authorities in Rome, to get his
doctorate... well, that's my best recollection. But I think he's a convert,
and he may well have the faith. Not that he didn't believe in the devil before
attending these exorcisms, but he certainly believed in the devil after
attending them, and he learned a lot.

He gave four reasons why people get possessed. One, they positively want to be
taken over by the devil. Two, somebody puts a hex on them—that's for real.
Three and four, I can't remember the other two ways. It'd be interesting to
remember. Too bad. But he certainly believed in the devil after attending these
exorcisms. It's very clear, so nobody in his right mind will deny the existence
of the devil and the existence of many, many devils.

Any questions on chapter nine?

### The Crusading Passion of Modern Liberalism

We're still in the sixth trumpet. The whole of chapter 10 and the first part
of chapter 11 is still the sixth trumpet. The first part of chapter 11 will
be the two witnesses, thought to be Enoch and Elias. We'll come to that.

Are the plagues in verse 20... (indistinct audience question).
Sulfur, smoke, and fire, yes. That's what I think they are. It's not the three
woes. The three woes are the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets. So it's
sulfur, fire, smoke, and sulfur. Yes.

Notice today, the incredible, crusading passion with which Liberals fight
to destroy the rest of Christendom. It's unbelievable. It's a bogus
Christianity. It's an imitation of Christianity; it's Christianity turned
against itself. It's the fruits of Christianity turned against the roots of
Christianity. It's the manner and mode of Christianity turned against the
substance. It's terrible. But the crusading righteousness with which these
journalists and politicians get up and get all psyched up, and get everybody
else psyched up on these completely bogus and false campaigns.

I can give you an example. Two or three years ago, Clinton began screaming all
over the media because a few churches got burned in the South. The media
immediately whipped up a whole campaign about how whites were burning Black
churches. Within a few days, Clinton was promising eight million federal
dollars to pay for these Black churches, and it was all over the newspapers.
The whole thing was completely false. There was no campaign. The FBI went into
it and found no campaign. It was just, you know, a mouse had eaten into some
wiring somewhere, a church got burned down here, and another one, just a few
accidents, and they made it into a campaign.

Gardner? Officially, several cases of actual arson by the Blacks.
Oh, arson by the Black community, sorry. What's known as Jewish lightning.
Do all of you know what Jewish lightning means? They are past masters at
destroying their own property to collect insurance. If they have a business
that is going badly and they want to start over, they set fire to their own.
So, "It was lightning from the sky that hit my business." Completely bogus
fire, arson, yeah, that figures.

An audience member commented that the worst part was seeing huge front-page
headlines of hate crime with whites burning Black churches, and then when white
ministers were caught having committed arson, it was relegated to page four.
That's it. There you are. You see, the Apocalypse is talking about this
corruption, these vile words to stir up the smoke so that people can't see
where they are. The agitation, passion, and confusion. People all psyched up
and blinded, so they have no idea what they're doing. People don't know their
right hands from their left hands today; they're so dumb. It's very, very grave.

### The Endurance of Faith in Difficult Times

And if these days were not shortened, even the elect, if it were possible,
would perish, says Our Lord. In days like today, if this situation goes on
for too long, it's not the dear little old Society that's going to be able
to stand up to it. The Society's just not built for that. You might as well
ask a lifeboat to stay for months on the open ocean in a raging storm; a
lifeboat can't do it. It's wonderful what the Society has done, and it will
serve the function that God wants it to serve. How much longer? I don't know.
But it can't replace the Church, and it can't survive... I don't know how
much longer. Well, it's surviving now.

Don't take me to be saying that it's threatened and cracking and breaking up,
and we'll soon all be swimming, so put on your life jackets. I don't think
we'll need life jackets today or tomorrow. The Society's got more endurance
in it than that. But it hasn't got, of its nature, humanly speaking, there's
no proportion between the strength of the Society and the strength of this
storm. The strength of the storm is still building. I don't think you can say
that the strength of the Society is building. It is in a way, insofar as every
day the priests of this Society are getting one day older. Many young priests
are no longer in their 20s; some are in their 30s, quite a lot now in their
40s. So they're approaching their best priestly years, in a sense. Many are
now moving into their best priestly years, when they have the best combination
of strength and wisdom. They've still got some strength of youth but are
getting a bit of the wisdom of age. Of course, the real wisdom of age only
comes somewhat later, sort of mid-50s. That's when you really start to
understand what it's all about. You can't expect youngsters to believe that.
They think they know it all. So, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

Any other questions on chapter nine?

## Apocalypse Chapter 10: The Mighty Angel and the Little Book

All right, we move onto chapter 10. We're still in the sixth trumpet.
Chapter 10 concerns the Antichrist himself. Chapter nine was the struggle
against the heresies preceding the Antichrist—the locusts and these horses and
their horsemen. Chapter nine presented a vision of the build-up towards the
Antichrist, the state of mankind with whom the preachers must deal. Chapter 10
and the first half of chapter 11 deal with the Antichrist himself. Chapter 10,
a renewal of the Gospel. Chapter 11, the return of the two witnesses. Both are
means of combating the Antichrist. The seventh trumpet at the end of chapter 11
will be the final preachers just before the general judgment. So now we are
fully under the Antichrist.

"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud
and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as the sun and his feet as
pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open and he set his
right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. And he cried with
a loud voice as when a lion roareth, and when he had cried seven thunders
uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices,
I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, 'Seal up
the things which the seven thunders have spoken and write them not.'"

### The Mighty Angel Identified as Christ

Chapter 10 verse one: "I saw another angel..." This other angel is Christ.
Strong, coming down from heaven. "I saw another mighty angel come down from
heaven," strong to endure His passion. "Clothed with a cloud." Clothed with a
cloud is the flesh of Christ. His human nature, His flesh, which is almost
immaterial, quasi-immaterial. Of course, the flesh of Christ was material,
but it's so under the power of the soul that it's the most spiritualized
matter that there ever was, the flesh of Our Lord. So it's quasi-immaterial,
like a cloud. A cloud is quasi-immaterial, unworldly, above this earth. It
shields men from the sun of God's anger, and it is laden with a rain of
graces, R-A-I-N. This cloud of the flesh of Our Lord is laden with a rainfall
of graces. Isaiah 19, verse one.

"And there was a rainbow around his head." A rainbow was on his head, his
face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. The rainbow around his
head is peace with God. That's what the rainbow signified from the time of
Noah. God said the rainbow is the pledge that I will not again flood mankind.
So the rainbow is a sign of peace between man and God. The rainbow around this
angel's head is the peace with God, not the peace of God, but peace with God
filling the thoughts of Christ.

The sun, S-U-N, is the splendor of Christ's divinity, His godhood. And his
feet were like columns of fire. What are His feet? Vera? Preachers. Yes, the
preachers. Blessed are the feet of those who announce the gospel. The feet
are the preachers of Christ carrying His gospel to all the world. Isaiah 52:7.
These feet are columns of fire, columns of firmness and endurance in taking
the weight. Uprightness, firmness, endurance in taking weight, W-E-I-G-H-T.
Columns of fire, like the column of fire which led the Israelites in the
desert, the Shekhinah, I think it was called. The pillar of fire.

The fire here is charity. It's not destructive passion and confusion. Here,
it's the fire of charity which enlightens men's minds. How can charity
enlighten a mind? Because charity is in the will, and the will follows the
intellect. *Causae ad invicem sunt causae*. Causes cause one another,
*sed aliter et aliter*, but in two different ways. The intellect informs the
will, but it's the will that moves or applies the intellect.
*Noluit intelligere ut bene ageret*. He did not want to understand. He didn't
want to know and therefore he blinded himself, made himself not know. He
wanted to know or he wanted not to know. That's the will moving the intellect.
So if the will is full of charity, then it moves the intellect in the right
direction. The direction in which the intellect looks is determined by the
will. What the intellect sees when it looks is determined by the intellect.
It's the intellect that picks up what's out there, but it's the will that
makes the intellect move in this direction or that direction. So, charity
will make the intellect look in the direction of the truth and pick up the
truth by moving it in the right direction.
