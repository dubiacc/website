Spiritual conference on St. Paul's 2 Corinthians 3-7: the essence of the priesthood and
the New Covenant written on hearts rather than stone. Further discussion of a prophecy by
Alois Irlmaier and the three days of darkness. Further interpretation of the seventh trumpet
of the Book of Apocalypse.

# The Priesthood, Prophecy, and Chastisement

Bishop Williamson first delves into St. Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians,
elucidating the nature of the Catholic priesthood as God's 'letter of
recommendation' and emphasizing the New Covenant's spiritual glory written on
human hearts, as prophesied by Jeremiah. He highlights the priest's role,
frailty, and divine empowerment, urging listeners to seize the present moment of
grace and avoid worldly compromises.

He then presents a stark and detailed prophecy from an Austrian visionary,
foretelling a severe global chastisement. This includes initial conflicts in the
Balkans, the destruction of New York by terrorist-deployed atomic devices, a
worldwide 'rain of fire,' widespread civil wars, a Russian invasion of Europe,
Chinese attacks, a cataclysmic event near Prague, a global earthquake, and three
days of darkness. 

His grace asserts this sequence of events is a deserved consequence of contemporary sins and likely to unfold within the
lifetime of his audience. He advises that the proper response involves steadfastly
performing one's duty of state and prayer, with the ultimate goal of dying in
the state of grace.

He concludes by interpreting key passages from the Book of
Revelation. He links the seventh trumpet to an urgent call for conversion,
explaining that God's interventions, however harsh, are aimed at saving souls.
He further deciphers the multifaceted symbolism of the Woman and the Dragon,
presenting the Woman Clothed with the Sun as representing:

1. The Church (clothed in Christ, with the changing world under its feet, and guided by apostolic teaching)
1. The Blessed Virgin Mary (clothed in the Word, yearning to save souls and sharing in Christ's suffering)
3. Holy souls in purgatory (yearning for heaven).

## Introduction

Firstly, the spiritual conference tonight will be by Bishop Fellay, and Tuesday
night, and Thursday night.

## The Priest's Letter of Recommendation: Reflections on 2 Corinthians

Secondly, who can tell me what this is? 

> You are our letter of recommendation.
> The New Testament being written as it should be, not on mosaic tablets of stone,
> but on your hearts, for it is a testament of the spirit and of life,
> incomparably more glorious even than the Old Testament blazing in glory, which
> made Moses veil his face. Alas, that Old Testament is still veiled from the Jews,
> but Catholics worship God in spirit, in liberty, and in true glory.

> Therefore, we Catholic priests preach with courage out in the open, hidden only
> from disbelievers, Jesus Christ, for your sakes, light of God's glory. However,
> we priests remain fragile creatures, vulnerable to all kinds of suffering unto
> death, so that you should have life, but we are confident that Jesus will give
> life to ourselves also, an enormous reward in heaven for our little troubles now.

> For we know that heaven is our destination, our desire, so long as we die in
> the state of grace, and God gives us confidence that we will go to Him, so we do
> our best for Him because we will all be judged on the good or bad we have done.

> God sees our hearts. We hope you do too, because all we do is for your sakes,
> to bring you to Christ who died for us all, reconciling us with God as we priests
> tell. Do listen and do seize the moment of grace which is now, for we priests are
> poor creatures, downtrodden by the world, but the power of God is within us.
> Your problem is not ourselves, but yourselves.

> Do realize as Catholics, you cannot mix with the world which is radically
> opposed to Christ. Leave the world behind you and then God will come to you.

> So leave behind impurity and recognize that we are your true friends. What joy
> it was for us to meet Titus bringing good news of your love of me. I am so happy
> that my letter made you sorry with a true and fruitful sorrow. You made Titus see
> that I was right to trust you. How we rejoice.

This passage is from 2 Corinthians, specifically the difficult chapters three,
four, five, six, and seven. It is difficult to sort out, difficult to make a
plan of, but St. Thomas says that 2 Corinthians is about the priesthood.
1 Corinthians is about the Eucharist, marriage, and baptism. And 2 Corinthians
is about the priesthood, the sacraments of the New Testament. St. Paul is having
to defend himself against the Corinthians who are accusing him of all kinds of
things. But in these chapters, the ideas just come tumbling out one after another.

The line is there: "You Corinthians are our letter of recommendation." That
immediately makes him think of the Old Testament prophet who talks about the New
Testament being written on hearts of flesh and no longer on tablets of stone.
That prophet is Jeremiah. Jeremiah 31. Look at that because it's an important
passage.

### The New Covenant Written on Hearts (Jeremiah 31)

Jeremiah 31, verse 31: "Behold the days will come, says the Lord, 'and I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not
according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day that I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.'" That is Sinai, the
Old Testament, obviously. "'The covenant which they made void and I had dominion
over them,' says the Lord. 'But this shall be the covenant that I will make with
the house of Israel after those days,' says the Lord. 'I will give my law in
their bowels and I will write it in their hearts and I will be their God and
they shall be my people.'"

There are no tablets of stone in the New Testament. It is a testament of grace
inscribed on hearts. "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and
every man his brother saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all shall know me from the
least of them even to the greatest," says the Lord. "For I will forgive their
iniquity and I will remember their sin no more."

In other words, you are not going to have instruction like the rabbis
instructed. Children and adults are not going to have to learn all of the
Pentateuch or all of the 613 rabbinical precepts. True, Catholics will need to
know their catechism. But learning the catechism is going to be nothing like as
exteriorly burdensome as it is for a Jew. It is going to be quite a simple
affair, and the child of five in the new covenant is going to be able to be full
of grace and to know all about God without having had to learn a great deal.
Of course, he should proportionately with his age learn everything that is
fitting to learn about his religion. But the essence of this religion is not
going to be what you learn, not what you know of the law, not what you observe
of all the external precepts. It is a religion that is going to be inside. The
law is driven inside. It is much simpler, much deeper, much more spiritual.

"They shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother
saying, 'Know the Lord.' For all shall be made from the least of them even to
the greatest," saith the Lord. Children of five and six can make some of the best
Catholics because the essentials can be there. "I will forgive their iniquity
and I will remember their sin no more." Thus saith the Lord, who give you the
sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and the stars for the light
of the night, who stirred up the sea. "I will give my law in their bowels... I
will write it in their heart." That is the famous quotation from Jeremiah about
the New Testament.

### Superiority of the New Testament (Hebrews 8)

Turn to Hebrews 8, where Saint Paul picks up on that quotation from Jeremiah.
Saint Paul is picking up on that quotation precisely because the theme of
Hebrews is the superiority of the New Testament to the Old Testament. And there
you have it in the Old Testament that the New Testament is going to be superior.
That is the best argument of all to persuade people who believe in the Old
Testament that the New Testament is superior: a quotation in the Old Testament
itself saying the New Testament is superior.

"And now he hath obtained a better ministry, for how much better also is he to
mediate a better testament, which is a section on better promises." Because if
the former testament had been faultless, there would not have been a place for a
second testament. But finding fault with the Old Testament, he saith, "Behold,
the day shall come," and that quotation from Jeremiah follows. And now in verse
13 of Chapter 8 of Hebrews, "In saying new, he hath made the former old, and
that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end." In other words, the New
Testament has superseded the old, which is the whole argument.

### St. Paul's Message to the Corinthians: A Summary

So, you Corinthians are our letter of recommendation. The New Testament being
written as it should be, this is Chapter 3 of 2 Corinthians, not on mosaic
tablets of stone, but on your hearts. Because the New Testament is a testament
of the spirit and of life, incomparably more glorious even than the Old
Testament, although the Old Testament blazed in glory, such glory that Moses had
to veil his face in front of the people. The people could not talk to Moses
because the glory of the Lord that he had been talking to so shone on Moses'
face that he had to put a veil in front of his face.

Alas, that Old Testament is still veiled from the Jews. Saint Paul jumps
cleverly from the veil covering Moses' face to the veil covering the Old
Testament, in the sense that the Jews could not look on the brightness of Moses'
face because of the glory. But now the Jews cannot see anything in the Old
Testament; they cannot see the real glory of God in the Old Testament. It is
blocked off from them. The Jews, for 2,000 years, have been carrying in their
synagogues all over the world the Old Testament. They are faithful carriers of
the Old Testament, but it is a closed book to them. They cannot get inside it
because they refuse to believe in Jesus Christ. The Old Testament is still
veiled from the Jews, whereas Catholics worship God in spirit, in liberty, and
in true glory.

Chapter 4: "Therefore, we Catholic priests preach." He does not say Catholic
priests, he says apostles, but it is the same thing. The essence of what Paul is
talking about is the Catholic priest. "We Catholic priests preach with courage
out in the open, hidden only from disbelievers." The glory of the New Testament
is out in the open, it is not hidden. But it is hidden from disbelievers. The
Catholic Church is there in the streets. Everybody knows it. But if you do not
believe, you cannot see what it is. "We preach Jesus Christ for your sakes, the
light of God's glory. However, we priests remain fragile creatures. We carry
this treasure in vessels of clay. We are vulnerable to all kinds of suffering
unto death so that you should have life. However, we are confident that Jesus
will give life to ourselves also and an enormous reward in heaven for our little
troubles now."

Chapter 5: "For we know that heaven is our destination, our desire, so long as
we die in the state of grace." And Paul says "clothed." We want to die clothed;
that is the garment of the wedding feast. "And God gives us confidence that we
will go to him." Does this ring a bell for those who did Saint Paul last year?
God gives us confidence. What gave the Galatians confidence? The Spirit of God
crying, "Abba," Father, within us. It is also in Romans. "God gives us
confidence that we will go to Him, so we do our best for Him because we will all
be judged on the good or bad we have done. God sees our hearts. We hope you do
too because all that we do is for your sakes, to bring you to Christ who died
for us all, reconciling us with God as we priests tell. Do listen and do seize
the moment of grace which is now."

This corresponds to Romans; Romans 1 and 2 Corinthians are all written about
the same time, there are many cross-references. Romans 13: "Now is the time to
convert, now is the day pleasing to the Lord, now is the time to convert." That
is an epistle at the first Sunday of Advent. Romans 13:11: "Knowing this is that
it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep, for now our salvation is nearing
the way we believe. The night is past and the day is at hand. Let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk
honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering
impurities, not in contention and envy, but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ
and make no provision for the flesh in its conquered businesses."

That corresponds to 2 Corinthians 6: "Do seize the moment of grace which is
now. For we priests are poor creatures, downtrodden by the world, but the power
of God is within us. Your problem is not ourselves, but yourselves." The
Corinthians obviously had been trying to say that Paul was inadequate. And Paul
is saying, "No, I am sorry. You are the problem, not me."

"Do realize, as Catholics, you cannot mix with the world." This is the famous
passage about the incompatibility of Christ and the world, Belial, at the end
of 2 Corinthians 6. "As Catholics you cannot mix with the world which is
radically opposed to Christ. Leave the world behind you and then God will come
to you."

Chapter 7: "So leave behind impurity and recognize that we priests are your true
friends. What joy it was for us to meet Titus bringing good news of your love
of me. I am so happy that my letter made you sorry with a true and fruitful
sorrow." This possibly refers to 1 Corinthians or a letter that got missed in
between 1 and 2 Corinthians. "You made Titus see that I was right to trust you.
How we rejoice."

He then notes that 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 are famous for discussing money, where
St. Paul talks for two chapters about money without once mentioning the word.

## A Prophetic Glimpse into Future Chastisements

In connection with the apocalypse, consider this.

### The Visions of an Austrian Farm Worker

A strong farm worker who stands with both feet on the earth sees very real
pictures of a coming great war between East and West. He lives in the area of
Zwettl in Lower Austria, about 25 kilometers from the Iron Curtain as it then
was. In 1987, he was still alive but kept very quiet. He did not want to be
known publicly and gave no information to anyone who visited him.

Ever since his 21st year, that is 1959, things happen in this way with him. If
he is completely relaxed and sitting down on a chair, or if he is woken up in
bed, but wide awake and with open eyes, he sees in front of him something like
films, like in a cinema. In the corners of the room, he can still see the
background of the room that he is in, but there is like a film in front of him.
In the middle of his vision, he sees these events. He even sees himself in these
coming events as a talking and acting person. For instance, he saw the
television announcement of Kennedy's murder exactly sometime before the
president was killed in 1963.

For a long time, he paid no great attention to these visions. Only when he heard
that there were men who had second sight, and when, in 1975 for the first time,
he got hold of a book of prophecies in which things were similarly described to
what he had seen himself, only then did he begin to pay any attention to his
experiences. He found that his own visions corresponded mostly with "The Song of
the Linden Tree" by Holzhauser, the report of Alois Irlmaier, and Father
Hantwerker from the 18th century.

This farm worker sees overlapping events without them being in ordered
succession, and therefore in their order, there may be mistakes. As for the time
they are going to happen, he can only speculate and try to work back from the
events, for instance, from the development of means of transport that he has
seen, how old certain people look that he knows, whether houses have been built
in this and that place where there are still none. From the vegetation, he can
sort of make a guess at the time.

### Sequence of Cataclysmic Events

Things begin in the area of the Adriatic, a limited conflict in the Balkans, and
end in Turkey. This little booklet was put out in 1987, before troubles began
in Yugoslavia. That is where the first great, large-scale atom bombs are used.
On the fields in our part of Austria here, I saw hardly any vegetation. It was
spring. The men in the rest of Europe, Austria and Germany, were saying with
relief to one another, "Thank goodness nothing is happening with us."

#### Initial Conflicts and the Destruction of New York
Flooding in the Mediterranean Sea was caused by atom bomb explosions at a great
height over the Adriatic. The shocks were clearly felt in our own area. The
destruction of New York through an act of terrorism is the beginning of the real
war, but still without notable effects upon mid-Europe.

#### Escalation to Global War and Natural Disasters
The next phase is the falling of like a worldwide fire rain, a rain of fire,
which sets everything on fire. We are in early summer, and there is still no war
in Austria. Before the outbreak of the complete and great war, the leftists
hold a triumphal procession because there are civil wars throughout the European
community, and there is war in East Africa from north to south, supported by
Russia.

Once there is trouble from civil war, then through Austria, the Russian tank
regiments march or charge through in the direction of the Adriatic, Italy, and
Yugoslavia, as well as north of the Danube, in the direction of Bavaria. Only in
the middle of the summer does it come to short and total war. So, this vision
is of events starting some spring—I am not saying this next spring, I do not
know—and piling up until there is total world war in the mid-summer.

There is a struggle in the Middle East, in the oil countries, where the Russians
throw out the Americans. China attacks in South Siberia and also with tanks in
the area north of Vienna and Bohemia. His vision is of the Chinese attacking the
Russians and then the Chinese coming through.

Finally, things are set on fire by a huge bomb attack in the neighborhood of
Prague. The Earth's surface gets torn apart in that part of the world, and
volcanic poison gases and magma come pouring out. There is week-long poisoning
of the Earth's atmosphere and a huge worldwide earthquake as a consequence. For a
whole day, the Earth shakes and trembles. Imagine anything trying to stay
standing.

#### The Three Days of Darkness and Its Aftermath
Then a judgment of God: breathing difficulties, three days' darkness, many
people dying, brings to an end the madness of the armaments race and of man's
pride. After that, there is in a German cathedral the consecration of an emperor
and the return of the pope who had fled, back to Rome. Islam is finished, and
all Christian churches and sects reunite. The few survivors will for a couple of
dozen years live in the fear of God, in Christian love of neighbor, in piety,
and in peace. Happy anybody who experiences that time.

### The Chastisement in Our Lifetime

This is it. This is the kind of future that stands in front of us, which stands
in front of you, and I think it is going to be in the lifetime of all of us. I
think this is easily in my lifetime as well as yours. This is the chastisement,
the end of the Fifth Age, and the coming into the Sixth Age of the Church. What
I do not think I will see is the Antichrist. I think some of you may see, but I
think all of us are going to see this. I do not think it is very far away.

These events in a little more detail: the destruction of New York happens in
early summer. In mid-Europe at that point in time, we are still not
experiencing any kind of war. New York will be quite unexpectedly destroyed
through two small atom bombs, dropped from above, which will explode amongst the
houses. The skyscrapers and buildings of Manhattan do not fall over or collapse
immediately, but they are mostly, while remaining complete and only leaning over
a little, pushed aside by the force of the explosion. It looks as though they
sort of gently and quietly lean over and fall. They will be at the same time
worn away from underneath like a carrot which one scrapes over a vegetable dish.
And they will get smaller and smaller until then they fall down, and the area on
which the famous New York skyline rose will be flat earth.

I saw myself standing after the announcement on the radio with other inhabitants
of the village and commenting on the event. According to what was said, it must
have been some daring attack by some psychopathic opponent—Gaddafi, or much more
likely now, Saddam Hussein. The United States, in order to try to cut off
impeachment proceedings, threw a whole lot more rockets at Iraq in a way that
Iraq had no immediate way of defending itself against, all in the name of
righteousness, in the name of the United Nations. Imagine how furious those
Arabs are. The only thing that could be said in favor or in defense of the
Americans is that they are the tools of others. And the Arabs know that. The
Arabs know who their real enemy is, which is why they will bomb New York. It is
very likely. They will just want to destroy all that vermin in New York. With a
bit of luck, they could get the whole Senate in one go.

I heard them say that this would be the act of revenge of terrorists. Exactly. It
is the act of revenge of terrorists. That is exactly what it would be. Very
possible. In 1987, can you imagine? People were saying, "Certainly that what the
Americans have done was not very good, but that they therefore go to destroying
a whole city, that is surely going too far." So, it is interesting.

### Justification for Divine Punishment

All I can say is, I do not know if these details are true. I do not know if it is
going to happen exactly like this. What I do know is that the sins of today's
world absolutely match something like this happening. You have heard me say
several times, if the sins prior to 1914 caused the First World War, which was
an unimaginable horror in its own time—and now people look back at 1910 to 1914,
"Oh, it was a wonderful age. What was so sinful about it?" Well, of course, the
Freemasons were triumphant in France, in Germany, in England. The Freemasons
were running the United States. All the nations had to be punished because they
had all given themselves over to the devils of Freemasonry. But apparently, life
was sweet and nice. People look back at it as a golden age before the First
World War. The sins were so bad, they caused the First World War.

Then we came into the period between the two wars, which only lasted from 1918
to 1939. That is only 21 years. And again, looking back today, what were the big
sins of the 1920s and 30s? And yet there was a Second World War which was much
worse than the first. The First World War was about 14-15 million casualties.
The Second World War was, they say, about 60-66 million casualties. So the
Second World War was much worse than the first. What were the terrible sins
between the two wars?

Then you think of 50 years, 1945 to 1995 plus some, you think of the sins of
these last tens of years, twice as long as in between the two wars, and much
more than twice as sinful. So if World War II was proportionate to the sins
between the two wars, what is proportionate to the sins that have been building
up since the Second World War? Something of this sort. That is the world that is
in front of you, in front of me too. This is reality. For my money, this is
reality.

### Our Response: Duty, Prayer, and the State of Grace

So, what can you do about it? What can you and I do about it? Not much. The
inhabitants of the cities are going to be racing through the country grabbing
anything to eat, murdering, killing, et cetera, to all the inhabitants of the
country. Everybody is going to be punished, because of course there is probably
today just as much television in the country as there is in the city. Just as
many abortions in the country as in the city. Somebody was telling me, in
Germany I think it was, now the dance halls are just as bad out in the country
as they are in the city. It is a citified way of life. It is an industrialized,
monetized, and citified way of life out in the country. There is very little
left of what used to be the old-fashioned, virtuous country way of life. That is
gone, that is finished. The corruption of the city has gone way out all over
the country. Therefore, the country is going to be punished as well. In God's
books, which are the only books that count, every reason to think the country
will be punished just as badly as the city.

So, what can you do about it? Duty of state and prayer. You and I do our duty
day by day according to what presents itself to us as our duty, and the only
important thing, always, of course, is to die in the state of grace. That is
the only thing that matters. What does it matter if the world falls down around
my ears and I die in the state of grace? What does it matter if I own all of the
skyscrapers in Manhattan and die in the disgrace of God?

But it is going to be very unpleasant, and as they say in French, "We will not
have stolen it." In other words, this horrible future has been well deserved. It
belongs to us. It fits. It is what is due to us, and it is what is coming. So,
as they say in American, "Enjoy."

## The Apocalypse: Interpreting Revelation

This is not even the end of the world. What it is going to be like at the end of
the world is another ball game. But these prophecies fit entirely the idea,
which is really quite frequent in prophecies, that there is going to be a great
chastisement, the destruction of a large part of mankind, a period of peace and
conversion, and a great and glorious triumph of the Church, with perhaps many
of the machines gone and a much simpler and healthier way of life. And then the
corruption of that is the arrival of the Antichrist, maybe 30, 40 years after
the chastisement. Who knows?

### The Seventh Trumpet and the Call to Conversion (Revelation 11)

At the end of chapter 11 of Revelation, I think we had not quite finished. The
seventh trumpet. The seventh angel preaches, telling of the imminent second
coming and of the urgent need to convert. That, of course, is what all of these
horrible events are about, New York collapsing and so on. It is all about the
need for souls to be saved and the need for conversion. The Lord God would love
to be able to do it gently. He would love to not have to punish like that. He
would love to be able to avoid a third world war. But if men use their free will
to insist upon sinning, sinning, sinning, so that in the end all of them will
throw themselves into hell, the Lord God has got to intervene somehow. He has
got to break up that situation before absolutely everybody falls into hell.
Because if this situation went on much longer, there is no human reason why
society should survive. This situation is far more crazy than society is sane,
so to speak, except for the support of God, except for the help of God.
This is what stands in front of us. It is called Apocalypse. This is what lies
ahead of us.

So, verse 19 of Revelation 11, which says, "There was opened the temple of God
in Heaven and it was seen the Ark of the Covenant in His temple, and there were
thunder and voices and earthquakes and much hail." From the end of the world,
which was the seventh trumpet, we come back to the incarnation and the origins
of the church. So this is a new vision starting: the woman and the dragon. Verse
19 could have been put by the divider of chapters together with chapter 12. It
is a kind of transition verse.

### The Ark of the Covenant: Christ's Humanity

The temple of God is the spiritual worship of God. God is spirit and will be
worshipped in spirit (John 4, our Lord speaking to the Samaritan woman). A
spiritual worship is coming. After the Old Testament of blood and fear—that is
of course a caricature, but still—the New Testament opened up a religion of the
heart and of love. That is a dangerous statement, because there is plenty of
blood and fear in the New Testament, and there is plenty of love in the Old
Testament. Nevertheless, you see what it means. Delinquents exaggerate the
roughness of the Old Testament and the "love, love, love" of the New Testament,
and it is not to be exaggerated, but there is an element of truth, especially
since it was the Sacred Heart who revealed the love of God in a person.

The Ark of the Alliance here is the humanity of Christ, which is central to the
new worship. The apostles of Christ produce miracles (lightning), preaching
(voices), conversions (earthquakes), persecutions (hail). All hell breaks loose
as the apostles begin to preach the risen Lord. The whole Roman Empire goes into
convulsions, but finally converts. It stands to reason.

### The Woman and the Dragon (Revelation 12)

And then we come in chapter 12 to the famous vision of the woman and the dragon.
"And a great sign appeared in Heaven, a woman clothed in the sun, and the moon
beneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."

#### The Woman as the Church
The woman is firstly the Church. Not firstly the Mother of God, but firstly the
Church. Clothed in Christ (dressed in the sun) with the moon beneath her feet.
The woman is the Church clothed in Christ, having beneath its feet the moon,
i.e., the sublunary world. The Church is clothed in Christ and it has the world
beneath its feet. Why is the world compared to the moon? Because the moon
changes; it waxes and wanes. It is constantly changing, and therefore the moon
represents this world, which is always changing. So the constantly changing
world is beneath the feet of the Church. The 12-star crown is the teaching of
the 12 apostles.
When the Mother of God was put into a stained-glass window in the first
cathedral of the United States, which was in Baltimore, a 13th star was added
in the crown around the head of the Blessed Virgin, for the 13 original states.
The birth pangs—"she carried a child in her womb and she cried out as she gave
birth and she suffered greatly in order to give birth"—are the Church's yearning
to give birth to souls for all eternity.

#### The Woman as the Blessed Virgin Mary
Secondly, the woman does also stand for the Blessed Virgin Mary. That is why in
many a stained-glass window, she is shown thus; Our Lady of Guadalupe has the
moon beneath her feet. The woman is the Blessed Virgin Mary clothed in the Word
of God, with the 12 fruits of the Holy Ghost, yearning also to save souls, and
groaning over the cross and passion of her Son, tortured by the cross and
passion of her Son.

#### The Woman as Holy Souls
A third application, a third meaning of this woman clothed in the sun, is holy
souls. Again, the 12 stars are the 12 fruits, less of the Holy Ghost than with
the Blessed Virgin Mary, but still the 12 fruits, and they are yearning for
heaven. They are in great agony because they are yearning for heaven, the holy
souls in purgatory.
