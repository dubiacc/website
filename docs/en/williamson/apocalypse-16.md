Transcript of the talk by Bishop Williamson: The Plagues of Revelation 
and the Fall of Republics

# Apocalypse 16: The Plagues and the Fall of Republics

Bishop Williamson interprets the plagues described in Revelation chapter 16, 
explaining the symbolic meaning of the angels, waters, sun, beast, and the 
battle of Armageddon.

He then draws a parallel to the decline of the Roman Republic and the rise of the
Empire under Julius Caesar and Augustus, highlighting the transition from old virtues
to new realities and the preservation of outward appearances masking fundamental
change, which he compares to modern political trends.

## Revelation Chapter 16 Interpreted

Let's look at Revelation 16:6 to 4, briefly. The third angel and the doctors of
the third and fourth century. The rivers of the heretics flowing down. The fountains
where the rivers flow from are the heresiarchs. The blood is the heretic's bloody
punishment.

Verse 5: "I heard an angel of the waters saying, 'Thou art just, O Lord, who art
and who were who has judged us.'" The waters this time are the living waters flowing
from God's throne, because obviously it's a good angel. "Because thou hast, uh...
They have shed the blood of the saints and the prophets and thou has given them
blood to drink, for they deserve it." The heretics are the shedders of blood. As a
punishment, they must drink blood in hell.

"And I heard another from the altar saying, 'Even so the Lord God Almighty, true
and just are thy judgments.'" Another angel this time is the saints, verse 7, who
are speaking sincerely from the altar, and from the innermost sanctuary of their
hearts, pronouncing the justice of God's judgment.

Verse 8: "And a fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun..." The sun is the
Antichrist, the false sun. "And it was given to him with heat to afflict men." He
simply grew worse. The Antichrist grew worse. "And men grew hot with a great heat
and blasphemed the name of God, having power over these plagues, nor did they do
any penance in order to give him glory."

The heat of verse 9, "And men grew hot with a great heat and blasphemed the name of
God." The heat is the great tribulation of Matthew 24:21. "In those days, there
will be great tribulation." The heat is great tribulation of those days. Matthew
24:21. But men still sin. They do not do penance in order to give God glory. They
just go on sinning.

Verse 10: "And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast." The
fifth angel is the preachers against the disciples of the Antichrist, who are the
throne of the beast. Clinton is enthroned upon the delinquents in Washington and the
delinquents in the media. So similarly, the Antichrist is enthroned upon his
followers. "The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and the
kingdom became darkness." "And they chewed on their tongues for grief." As the
preachers against the disciples of the Antichrist, these disciples are the throne
of the beast. In other words, those amongst whom he finds repose, those upon whom he
leans his seat, those upon whom his power is seated, on whom he leans, on whom he
rests. But when they are punished, when the preachers preach against them, they grow
still less enlightened. They grow dark. "They grow still less enlightened and they
gnash their teeth in pain," like the Pharisees gnashed their teeth when our Lord
preached amongst them.

Obviously, there are many times. In John 8, they were furious within then. They
gnashed their teeth. It's certainly the sense of what the Pharisees did when our
Lord preached. So here, the followers of the Antichrist, under the effect of the
preaching of the fifth angel, simply grow worse. "And they gnashed their teeth for
pain, and they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and their wounds, and
they did not do penance from their works."

Verse 12: "And the sixth angel..." The sixth angel is preachers against pleasure,
money, and earthly goods. Materialism, if you like. "Preachers against pleasure,
money, and earthly goods. The Euphrates..." "The sixth angel poured out his vial
upon that great river, the Euphrates, and dried up its water in order that the way
be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun." The sixth angel is preachers
against pleasure, money, and earthly goods. The Euphrates is the mass of
conformists going with the current, going with the flow as we say. The mass of
conformists going with the flow, seeking only worldly goods. So the massive
materialists drifting down a stream, a great muddy river. It's a good image for the
masses. And the sixth angel dried up its water. The sixth angel demonstrated the
vanity of earthly goods, dried up the water of the Euphrates, demonstrated the
vanity of materialism. In order that the way be prepared for the kings from the
rising of the sun. The kings here are the true Christians who wish to reign with
Christ. The true Christians who wish to reign with Christ. The rising of the sun
is Christ from whom worldly goods distract people. He poured out his vial upon the
materialistic masses, demonstrated the vanity of their materialism in order to
prepare the way for them to turn to Christ. For the true Christians, enlightened by
Christ.

"And I saw," this is still the sixth angel, "I saw from the mouth of the dragon,
from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the pseudo-prophet, three unclean
spirits in the manner of frogs." From the mouth of the dragon, this is obviously
chapter 12, the dragon, the beast, and the pseudo-prophet, the false lamb, the
dragon, the first beast and the second beast, the dragon, the beast and the false
lamb. Chapter 13, the false prophet here, the heralds of the Antichrist. The heralds
of the Antichrist. In chapter 12, the false lamb was of great - chapter 13 rather,
chapter 13. The false lamb was a great servant of the Antichrist. The false lamb was
the pseudo church rallying religious feeling and religious opinion behind the
Antichrist, which is a very important thing to do. We shall certainly see the
Antichrist doing that, we see him already doing it. The world government has got the
new world church at its service. And the new world church will render the one world
government a great service because it's going to persuade people that the one world
government is Catholic. So the false prophet is the heralds of the Antichrist, the
false churchmen heralding the Antichrist, if you like. The false churchmen, the new
churchmen heralding the Antichrist.

Three spirits in the manner of frogs: black magic, worship of man, and false
philosophers. Black magic, the worship of man and false philosophers. In the manner
of frogs, why frogs? Because they sit in the mud and croak continually the same
senseless slogans. Listening to no opposite arguments. They croak continually the
same senseless slogans listening to no opposite arguments.

"For they are the spirits of devils doing signs." They are the spirits of devils
means they are inspired and led by the devil. These three frogs are inspired and led
by the devil. They work signs. They work signs, in other words, pseudo miracles
within the laws of nature. Pseudo miracles within the laws of nature. Prima Pars,
question 110, article four, Ad Secundum. Pseudo miracles, they're not really worked
by God and they don't need divine power to work them, but they are happenings outside
of the ordinary, which strike wonder into men because men don't see the angelic
powers, for instance, which work these wonders. If somebody on the stage holds up a
fork and suddenly the fork bends in his hand, you might call it a miracle. It isn't
anything of the sort, really. It's only that men don't see the angel who comes along
and bends the fork. It's very easy for an angel to do, to bend a fork, very easy, if
God allows him to. So there's an example. It's completely within the laws of nature
that an angel should come along and bend a fork so that all the audience gasps in
amazement when they see the fork being bent. But it's completely within the laws of
nature. There's nothing supernatural about it at all. All that is, is that it's not
normal for forks to bend by themselves and therefore it's outside of the normal, but
it's not outside of the natural if you include the angels in nature, obviously.

Therefore, false signs are signs which fall within nature, but outside of what men
normally see and can easily explain. And these are the signs that the false spirits
are going to work, working pseudo-miracles within the laws of nature. "And they
proceed to the kings of all of the earth to gather them together for war against the
great day of Almighty God." The kings are here, quite the opposite from the last
kings. The kings last time were the true Christians. Here, the kings are the secular
powers, all in league against Christ. The secular powers all in league against
Christ, but in fact, heading for their comeuppance on Judgment Day. They gather
together the kings of all of the earth for war, that's the purpose, but in fact,
against the great day of judgment. In other words, they don't realize it, but
they're simply heaping up for themselves wrath on the day of judgment. They're
heading for their, Americans say, comeuppance. They're heading for their punishment
on Judgment Day, the great day of the Almighty God.

Verse 15: "Behold I come like a thief" evokes, of course, the gospel warning of the
suddenness of Judgment Day. Matthew 24:43, "Behold I come like a thief," the Lord
God speaking. Matthew 24:43, the Lord God warning of the suddenness of Judgment Day.
"Blessed is he who keeps watch and guards his clothes, keeps his clothes clean, lest
he be caught walking naked and that his shame be discovered." The clothing is of
course the state of grace and accompanying virtues. Blessed is he who keeps watch
and keeps his clothes around him in order not to be caught bare and disgraced. So the
clothing of grace, blessed is he who keeps watch and keeps the state of grace
around him, keeps wrapped in the state of grace. So clothing is the state of grace
and its accompanying virtues.

Verse 16: "And he will gather them together in the place which is called in Hebrew,
Armageddon." Armageddon may be a physical place. For instance, in Israel, Palestine,
it's a place called Megiddo. Compare 4 Kings 23:29. "He will gather them together in
Armageddon." A place called in Hebrew, Armageddon, maybe Megiddo. Allegorically, the
word means dark mountain. In other words, the Antichrist, who is going to be a
mountain of pride. So all souls are going to be gathered towards the Antichrist,
gathered around the Antichrist, so to speak, for the last judgment.

## The Seventh Angel and the Signs of the End

"And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air and there came forth a great
voice from the temple and the throne saying, 'It is finished.' And there was
lightning and voices and thunder and a great earthquake, such as there was never
from the time that men were upon earth, such an earthquake so great. And the great
city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And Babylon
the Great was recalled before God to give it the chalice of the wine of the
indignation of His wrath. And every island fled and the mountains were found no
more. And a great hail like as big as talents descended from heaven upon the men and
they blasphemed God on account of the plague of the hail because it was so
vehemently great."

The seventh angel is preachers against devils. Preachers against devils. The air is
devils'. The devils are not thrown out of Heaven. Until the day of judgment, some of
them are allowed to... They're not all trapped in hell. You may remember the gathering
of swine who begged not to be forced back to hell. So they're allowed in the
intermediate regions and that's why Saint Paul will say, Ephesians 2 verse 2: "And
you when you were dead in your delights and in your sins in which once you walked
according to this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, spirits
who now... the prince of the power of this air, of this atmosphere." So the idea is
the devils, the air has connection with the devils.

So he pours out his vial upon the air, he pours out his vial upon the devils beneath
heaven, not yet all trapped in hell. Preaches against the devils who inhabit the air
between heaven and earth in the last times. And there came out a great voice from
the temple from the throne saying, this voice is the voice of God announcing that
the world is finished. It's over. The voice of God announcing that the world is
finished.

And in verse 18, there follow signs at the end of the world. Matthew 24, the
Antichrist's last fling. The last fling of the Antichrist. Thunder, lightning, and
voices and thunder and earthquake. Lightning is pseudo-miracles which dazzle people,
like lightning dazzles. Lightning is pseudo-miracles. The voices are preaching,
various kinds of preaching. Thunder is threats and the earthquake is persecution. So
you've got lightning is pseudo-miracles, the voices are preaching, thunder is
threats, and earthquake is persecution. Matthew 24:21. That's a constant reference
to the discourse of our Lord about the end of the world. The earthquake is
persecution, Matthew 24:21.

"And the great city was made into three parts." What else was famously divided in
three parts? The beginning of Caesar's Gallic War. *Omnis Gallia in tres partes
divisa est.* All Gaul is divided in three parts. The famous opening words of Caesar's
Gallic War. Why did every schoolboy used to know Caesar's Gallic War? Answer, because
Caesar's Gallic War was always taught to schoolboys. Question, why was Caesar's
Gallic War always taught to schoolboys? It was written in a simpler style. Yeah.
Caesar's Latin is very pure and very correct, very pure, and very easy to read.
Besides being a great general, he was a master propagandist and a master politician.
He was a genius, there's no doubt about that. And he wrote his own account of the
Civil War and of the Gallic War, and both of them survived. He was a great writer as
well as a great politician and a great general. Very talented man, which is why from
then on, the Roman emperor was called Caesar. In German he's always called, the
emperor is called Kaiser, and in Russian he's always called Zar, same word. All for
one man.

He wrote his own account of his own war campaigns and it's very skillfully written to
make people think what a wonderful guy he was. And it succeeded to a great extent.
When he finished campaigning in Gaul, he took a long time to subdue Gaul. And the
first sentence of the Gallic War is all Gaul is divided into three parts and
describes his various campaigns.

## Digression on Julius Caesar and Roman History

The society's seminary in Flavigny is very close to a famous battle of Caesar,
extraordinary battle. What's it called? Where he defeated Vercingetorix who was a
Gaul with huge mustache. Vercingetorix. A real typical Gaul. He was the king of the
Gauls, or one of the most prominent tribes. The Gauls were all different tribes. If
the Gauls had only got together, they'd have beaten Caesar hands down. They'd have
crushed him, but they couldn't get together. And the problem with the French is that
they can't get together. They are always dividing into three parts, and then again
into three parts. So, Vercingetorix. Now, what is the name of that battlefield near
Flavigny? It's right next door. It's a hilltop. It's a large hilltop. Alesia? No,
it's a name like Alesia. Alesia. How do you spell it? A-L-E-S-I-A. I think that's
it. Alesia. That was the Roman name.

He was holed up. So what the Romans did... The Romans were disciplined. The
enormous thing about this business, the Romans, is they were disciplined. So the
Romans come along with a small army, under Caesar, and they simply build a trench all
around the hill and close him in. Today, you can fly over the area, which is right
next to our seminary in France, and you can still see the lines, some of the lines
in the cornfields. Aerial photography picks up these lines. And then, of course, if
you dig, you can still find the lines of the trenches. Sometimes, I think, with the
naked eye, you can sometimes see the slightly darker earth or whatever it is.

Then the Gauls were a bit galled by all this. So along they came. They decided
that they were gonna come and beat up the Romans. So they came from all sides to
come and beat up the Romans. So what did Julius Caesar do? Does he panic and run
away? No way. What does Caesar do? He builds a second line, a second line like that,
and then all the Romans run around in this area. They've got towers to protect.
There's a double ring. And so now the Romans, this small army is enclosing the Gallic
chief on top of the hill, while the masses, the hordes attack from all sides, but
they can't get their act together. So wherever they attack, the Romans just hold
them off. Finally, the Gauls have had enough because they didn't bring enough, uh,
Gauloise cigarettes with them, so they had to go home again. So the Gauls get fed
up. They're trying to beat the Romans from the outside. So off they go, home again,
and finally, Vercingetorix is taken, taken prisoner. The Romans defeat
Vercingetorix. He's taken prisoner. He's taken off to Rome. He's taken in chains to
Rome as part of Caesar's triumph, and he dies. He's killed in the Mamertine Prison
where Peter and Paul also were. He's killed in that prison a couple years later. And
that's how Caesar conquered Gaul, by discipline and by military skill against brave
men, much superior in numbers, but much less united and much less skilled, as far
as the military discipline is concerned. And you can see these lines. Of course,
they're not as neat as that. They much more follow the geography, but there's still a
village on top of the hill, and there are still these lines discoverable in the
earth. It's an extraordinary story.

Then when in Rome, meanwhile... Caesar was a politician as well. In Rome, this is,
we're around the year 50. Rome has been in some commotion. The great Roman Republic
which rested upon the virtue of the ancient Romans, the tough, the hardy,
self-controlled virtue, *viribus antiquis*, *moribus antiquis*. That's it.
*Moribus antiquis*. Famous line of Ennius. *Moribus antiquis stat res Romana*.
*Virial scole*. "By old morals stands the Roman thing." *Res Romana*, *res
publica*, republic. The word republic comes from *res publica*, the public thing.
So the Roman Republic is the Roman thing. "Stands the Roman thing, and by men." By
ancient morals and men stands the Roman thing. In other words, that's the strength
of Rome and the greatness of Rome and the building of Rome was the old-fashioned,
homespun virtue.

When Rome began building a great empire, the politics began. Now, the wealth, the
money, the creation of a big city in Rome, big population, because originally it
was nothing. When was Rome founded? The famous year? 753 BC. By Romulus and Remus.
Romulus, of course, the two children, the twins that were suckled by a wolf is the
story. And then Romulus killed Remus, and Romulus founded Rome. It comes from the
Rom-. So Romans and Roman Catholics because of a child suckled by a she-wolf. That's
the story. Romulus founded Rome, supposedly in 753.

Rome began with kings. The kings turned into tyrants. The Romans got rid of the
tyrants and got rid of the kings, which is when they founded their republic under a
system of government with consuls and praetors. This system of government lasted
very well, down to about the year 100 when the generals began... The first one was
Sulla or Marius. There were two generals who began getting into politics as generals
at the beginning of the first century BC, Sulla and Marius. And Roman politics was
somewhat perturbed because life does move on. Life was... The Roman Empire was
building. Around the middle of the... around 150, 160, the Romans meeting with...
The Romans appear in scripture because of? The Maccabees is right, yes. The
Maccabees encountered the Romans and make an alliance with the Spartans and then
they make an alliance with the Romans. And scripture expresses the admiration of
the Israelites, of the Jews, and of the Maccabees for the political savvy of the
administration of the Roman Empire, of these ancient men who built the empire.

But around 100, the political system is coming under strain because men are
changing, their ways are changing, luxury, big city. And the generals begin to get
into politics. There are two particularly, Sulla and Marius. And they both came a
little close to being dictators. A little close. Not yet, but they're getting that
way. Of course, the Roman constitution did allow for a dictator. That's where the
word originally comes from. When the Republic was under severe pressure, then the
Romans could hand over all power to one single man, one single general often. He
would deal with the crisis and then it would go back to consuls and it would go back
to normal. But in this case they were out of politics taking over power, not just
because there was a single crisis. So the system is coming under strain.

By the middle of the century, before our Lord, and that was about 55, 50 BC, Julius
Caesar... You had the two triumvirates. In 60, you had the... that's three men
essentially administering power. There was a triumvirate in 60, at which Pompey took
part, I think. The generals had becoming more and more prominent. And normally when
a Roman general... The Romans, in their constitution, forbade generals to take power,
and they forbade... it was written for the gen-... And a general coming back towards
Rome was ordered to leave behind his army when he crossed a little river called...
When he's coming from the north, if he crossed this little river, he had to leave
his army behind. He had to either go ahead of his army or he was supposed to come
behind it. But he wasn't allowed to come on Rome with his troops. Anybody know that
name of that little river? Rubicon? Rubicon is right, the Rubicon, which is still a
little river. The Rubicon. If you got Italy like that, the Rubicon will be somewhere
up here. There's Rome. It'll be somewhere around there. The Po is this huge river. The
Po flows eastwards. Yes, the Po flows east. The Po is that huge river. The Rubicon is
a tiny little river this way. So that's the Rubicon, that's the Po, that's for Rome.

So, Caesar coming back from Gaul, perhaps after he'd just finished at last
conquering it entirely. He'd obviously been staying in touch with the developments
in Rome. Caesar decided to cross the Rubicon with his army. And as he crossed the
river with his army, what did he say? Anybody know? *Alea iacta est*. *Alea iacta
est*. These are things you would all of you have learned in school if you had had an
old-fashioned education. "The die is cast." "The die is cast." In other words, he
had broken the rules of the republic. When he crossed with his army, he had broken
with the rules of the republic, and that was more or less the moment of the end of
the Roman Republic.

When Caesar then advanced on Rome with his army, I think Pompey fled to Brindisi.
Pompey fled because Pompey knew that he couldn't face up to Caesar with his army. I
think Caesar had him pursued. In any case, Caesar took command of Rome with his army
and was in effect the real ruler of Rome. His one-man rule... I may be getting a number
of details wrong. His effective rule lasted about six years, maybe less. In any
case, after a while the Romans reacted. That's the play of Julius Caesar by
Shakespeare. There was a conspiracy against him, and in the name of getting rid of a
dictator, which was a classical Roman tradition, we don't want kings, we don't want
dictators, and in the name of pretending to protect the old republic and to get rid
of this new dictator, Caesar was assassinated. *Et tu, Brute* in the capital. When
you were in Rome did you ask to see the spot where Caesar was killed?

When he was assassinated, it's not as though the old-fashioned republic immediately
revived. Men were no longer the same and you could get rid of Clinton and things
you won't go back to the old system by getting rid of Clinton because men are not
what they used to be. The old men and the old morals are virtually gone with
television, with pornography, with abortion, with all of this. You've got a new race
of men and therefore no wonder you've got new kinds of politics in Washington. It's
absolutely normal. It's a different world and people had better wake up to it.

So, there was a power struggle after Caesar's death, Mark Antony, Octavian and
Caesar's nephew, a young man called Octavian who was not a great general but who was
very... something of prig, Shakespeare suggests. But he was very... he was clean
living and he was politically very shrewd, Octavian. And in the fight that ensued...
Octavian is his name. I think he was a nephew of Caesar. In the fight they... so
from '44, Caesar was killed, assassination of Caesar. '30 was the Battle of Actium
and that was the final victory of Octavian over Mark Antony. Mark Antony was a friend
of Julius Caesar but Mark Antony, amongst other things, fell in love with Cleopatra
and that sort of paralyzed him. In any case, there was a sea battle with Cleopatra
there, Mark Antony on one side and Octavian on the other and Octavian won and from
then on it was the triumph of the new... that then began, really began the empire.

So the Roman Empire began from '30 and the Roman Republic came to an end really in
'44. So that was the transition and that's much the most interesting history, much
the most interesting century in Roman history, the first century BC, the transition
from the republic to the empire. Octavian was a very wise emperor, a very good
emperor and reigned from at least '30 until 14 AD. Yes, I think that's right. And he
established the Roman Empire, only he was smarter than Julius Caesar in one way, or
maybe he learned from Julius' assassination. Julius Caesar had not paid enough
respect to the outward forms of the old republic. He hadn't bowed in front of the
senators or he hadn't... he'd been a bit too brash and that's why they got rid of
him because they felt he was an upstart and too proud and gonna be a dictator and so
on.

So Caesar got himself assassinated because he wasn't careful enough to pretend that
the old system was still going which people do like. People like to feel the old
system is still going. So, Octavian took great care to preserve all of the appearances
of the old system, and he... I think he had two consuls. He had the whole Senate. He
paid his deference and all of that, so he didn't trample upon the old ways. He
pretended to respect all of the old ways when in fact it was something completely
new. And for Rome, it was completely new and it was the Roman Empire that then
lasted for another good 400 years. You had a string of emperors, some of them good,
some of them very bad, obviously.

But that's the story, a little of the story of Julius Caesar. He was a very brilliant
man, but a little careless of his fellow human beings' feelings. He was a little
careless of his fellow Romans' feelings. That was the time when Roman soldiers really
were Roman soldiers. They were conquering the world. They were administering a huge
empire. They were becoming... at the time, they were becoming the masters of the
world, of the known world and they did a pretty good job, generally speaking. Humanly
speaking, they did a pretty good job, which... the Romans could never have held that
huge empire had the peoples conquered not recognized that belonging, being under the
Roman Empire had great benefits.

I mean, it was like, you know... I mean, you had roads, you didn't have too many
robbers, you had the sea. Pompey had cleared the Mediterranean of pirates. You could
cross... so thanks to the Roman Empire, you could cross the Mediterranean without
getting attacked by pirates. You had those benefits of civilization. That's why, for
instance, the Gauls, once they were beaten by Julius Caesar... they're very warlike
and fractious and bloody-minded people, but they also... they quietened down quite
happily under the Roman Empire. They didn't rise up because they knew darn well that
this was... it was in the Romans... the Romans did them a lot more good than it did
them harm which is why, to this day, French is obviously a Latin language. Spanish,
Italian, French, Portuguese, they're all of the Latin countries were under the Roman
Empire, formed by the Roman Empire.

Then of course when Augustus had established peace and in the year one where they
closed the door of the Temple of Janus, which was the sign of peace, and at that very
moment when the whole civilized world, quote-unquote, "civilized" world was at peace,
then our Lord was born. So, it was all a providential preparation for Rome to be the
seat and throne of the Roman Catholic Church.

What else was I gonna say? Maybe I should... that's about it. It's quite a story and
it's all pagan, of course. Another great politician of this time was Cicero, who was
a great... the famous speaker. He's a wonderful orator. And his speeches still
survive in a beautiful Latin, but it's more complicated than Caesar's Latin. The
advantage of Caesar's Latin is it's quite simple. It's very beautiful, but it's
quite simple. Cicero's Latin... it's incomparable oratory. And he was active in this
period, this same period, and he committed suicide. He was being hounded down
because he was too important, too dangerous. Perhaps it was Caesar who hunted him
down. Caesar or one of the others, and he committed suicide. Another great general of
this time is Pompey. He it was who fought many of Rome's battles, and then he was
either killed in battle or I think rather... I think he also died on his own sword
in Egypt. He was being pursued by Caesar's men I think. Caesar was pursuing him. He
was assassinated. Assassinated was he? Okay, in Egypt. That's right. He was
assassinated then, but by Julius Caesar's men I think.

Caesar was a realist in politics. Whether Caesar saved his soul remains very much
open to doubt, but humanly speaking, it was a brilliant career. What age did he die?
About what age? 56 years. That would be about it. He wasn't all that old. Augustus
died somewhat older. He lived and he reigned for 44 years, and it was Augustus who
consolidated the new system, the empire. The Senate went on for some time in
appearance. The appearance went on for a long time. We may see the appearance of
Congress going on for a long time yet, but it's really been gutted.

Well, of course, the Congress is still, in theory, the legislative power. There's
a former... in the latest John Birch Magazine, The New American, there's an
interesting quotation by Robert Reich, who was Labor Minister under Clinton
earlier, and Robert Reich says in effect that the Congress is now virtually
irrelevant. It's completely bypassed. So...
