Transcript of the talk by Bishop Williamson: Introduction to the Apocalypse

# Introduction to the Apocalypse - Authorship, Dating, and Purpose

Bishop Williamson states that the Apocalypse was written by Saint John the
Evangelist, addressing external arguments that arose from Millenarist misuse of the
text and noting strong internal evidence for Johannean authorship. He explains
that ancient objections, primarily from Saint Dennis of Alexandria concerning
anonymity, style, grammar, vocabulary, and doctrine, are refutable. 

Bishop Williamson posits that the Apocalypse was likely composed during the reign of
Domitian (81-96 AD), a date supported by external proofs from early Church
Fathers like Irenaeus, Eusebius, and Jerome, and confirmed by internal evidence
from the historical situation depicted. He clarifies that the Apocalypse was
addressed to the seven churches of Asia Minor with the purpose of combating
emerging heresies, such as those of the Nicolaitans and the Gnostics (referred
to as Serenpism in the talk), and to encourage the wilting faith of Christians
awaiting Christ's second coming, teaching them that persecutions will pass and
the Church will triumph. 

Bishop Williamson also briefly mentions the textual basis of the Apocalypse and 
begins to outline its theological teachings, starting with
God's omnipotence and Christ's nature as both triumphant God-man and the Lamb.

## Introduction to the Apocalypse

We were last seeing whether it was written by Saint John, and the answer is yes.

## Authorship: Saint John the Evangelist

### External Arguments and Millenarist Influence

External arguments presented no real problem until the Millenarists, the people
who believe in the 1,000-year rule of Jesus Christ here on Earth, began misusing
the text of the Apocalypse. In order to counter the Millenarists, it was then
denied that Saint John truly wrote it, or arguments were sought to support this
denial. However, that is only a shadow upon the otherwise unanimous external
opinion that it is Saint John.

### Internal Arguments

Internal arguments indicate the author is a Jew living in Asia Minor, possessing
great authority, a hatred of God's enemies, calling himself John, and exiled on
Patmos. There are not many people who fit all these features other than John the
Evangelist.

### Objections to Johannean Authorship and Responses

Objections, mostly from Saint Dennis of Alexandria, are ancient, not modern. Saint
Dennis was worried about the Millenarists' misuse of the Apocalypse.

1.  **Anonymity vs. Stated Authorship**: The objection is that the Fourth Gospel is
    anonymous, whereas the Apocalypse states its author.
    *Response*: For the letters, it is obvious who the author is. In the Gospel,
    John does not want to put himself forward, though he discreetly indicates his
    witness ("These are things that I saw," "The disciple whom Jesus loved"). In
    the Apocalypse, which contains visions, he needs to assert his authority more
    obviously, so he declares, "This is John, this is John, this is John."

2.  **Style**: The style of the Gospel is flowing, while the style of the
    Apocalypse is jagged.
    *Response*: There are considerable similarities alongside any dissimilarities
    of style.

3.  **Grammar**: The grammar is more correct in the Gospel, less correct in the
    Apocalypse.
    *Response*: Yes, but the writer of the Gospel is still Jewish. For the
    Apocalypse, the Old Testament influence explains the larger number of Jewish
    expressions. Furthermore, there are similar grammatical particularities in
    both.

4.  **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary is very different.
    *Response*: Yes, but there are also remarkable similarities, while the
    contents explain the differences.

5.  **Doctrine**: The doctrine is very different.
    *Response*: Not substantially. The doctrine covers different ground in each
    case, but it is not contradictory. Angels naturally play a larger part in the
    Apocalypse than in the Gospel because angels are the ministers carrying out
    God's decrees. The last things appear in only one or two places in the
    Gospels but are the prime preoccupation of the Apocalypse.

    *False Contrasts*:
    *   "Christ is a nice guy in the Gospels; He's a nasty guy in the Apocalypse."
        This is a false contrast; He is both nice and nasty in both.
    *   "The Jews are bad guys in the Gospel, whereas Jerusalem and Israel are
        good guys in the Apocalypse."
        *Response*: In the Apocalypse, Jerusalem and Israel stand for the
        Catholic Church, not for the Annas and Caiaphas Jews.

## Date and Place of Composition

This is of certain interest. We have covered: 1. Title and literary
classification, 2. Unity and sources, 3. Canonicity and authenticity (that it
belongs to the canon of Scripture and who wrote it). Now, 4. Date and place of
composition.

### Thesis: Reign of Domitian (81-96 AD)

The thesis is that it was written in the reign of Domitian, 81 to 96 AD. So say
authors from the 1st to the 4th century.

### External Proofs

*   **Saint Irenaeus**: Irenaeus, writing around 180-190 AD, says that Saint John,
    quote, "Saw the Apocalypse almost in our time... towards the end of the reign
    of Domitian," unquote.
*   **Eusebius**: Eusebius states that the Apocalypse was written in the 14th year
    of Domitian, meaning about 94 or 95 AD.
*   **Saint Jerome**: Saint Jerome said the same thing. 
    These are three strong authorities, among others.

### Internal Confirmation

Working from the contents of the book, how can you date it? The historical
situation depicted points to the end of the first century. There are four
features:

1.  It contains no reference to Saint Paul in Ephesus, so Paul is ancient history.
    Remember, he was very active there.
2.  Churches in Asia Minor are growing slack or have grown slack (not all of them,
    as seen in Apocalypse Chapters two and three).
3.  Heresies are developing with the passage of time. They are not as active as
    they used to be.
4.  The "Pudii interrogative element" was dramatically overestimated. This period,
    which comes after the initial fervor of the church has died down, involves
    trying to find the source of the great material. There is some distance from
    the fervor of the initial churches; they are trying to figure out how to get
    back to the original church, often by copying the early Church Fathers, who
    knew what they were doing.

The early Church Fathers testified that John the Evangelist was the author and
that John the Evangelist had his visions on Patmos.

## Addressees and Purpose of the Apocalypse

Who were the first people it was sent to? The recipients, the audience.

### Addressees

The Apocalypse is addressed immediately to the seven churches. Remember what
"immediately" means in Scholasticism: without a medium.

### Purpose: Combating Heresy and Encouraging Faith

From inside the church, the heresy of Nicolaitans and Serenpism were emerging.
Serenpism is what it is called; Nicolaitanism is more or less what it says.
Serenpism, Gnosticism, is the main opposition to Christianity. Gnosis, in Greek,
means special knowledge. We still have the English word "agnostic," a person who
pretends not to know whether God exists. Gnostic and agnostic are opposed. In
modern English, an agnostic does not know if God exists; a Gnostic adheres to
some false version of Christianity as a special kind of knowledge.

Father Merriman, an interesting and very anti-liberal fellow, has written about
the Gnosis of John Paul II, following the Argentinean Vicario Maggio. Gnosis is a
word with many applications, but in this context, it is a general name for false
versions of Christianity raised by Judaism down the centuries. Every time Jews try
to turn Christianity into some special knowledge, or raise another heresy to help
destroy the Church, there is a connection between these heresies, like
Freemasonry and communism; they are all a kind of Gnosis. That is the argument.

I do not pretend to know much about Gnosis; it is so vague, foul, general, and
multiple. But those who study it present an interesting argument that in every
century, the main opposition to Catholic doctrine comes from this Gnosis. Behind
many heresies raised against Catholic doctrine, you find Gnosis in one form or
another. Neo-modernism is again a form of this age-old, repeated Gnosis. Heresies
are as old as the hills; the devil keeps giving them new forms. But what he gives
a new form to is this idea of some special knowledge, like "Keliadocum," about the
alpha and the omega, the omega point. It is the same old, tired, artificial,
supposed knowledge. That is Gnosis.

The Jews are argued by many to be behind it all. Freemasonry is another form of
Gnosis. The adoration of man, the replacement of God by man, is at the heart of
this age-old Gnosis. The worship of Lucifer and the worship of man, that is it.

From inside, the heresies of Nicolaitans and Serenpism were beginning. The
Gnostics, as they are called, began to get going towards the end of the first
century. It is against the Gnostics that Saint John wrote his Fourth Gospel,
particularly "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God," nailing all false ideas that the Word was some demiurge or
semi-divinity.

Look at the beginning of his First Epistle: "That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,
and our hands have touched, of the Word of life: For the life was manifested; and
we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was
with the Father, and hath appeared to us." The Word of life, the Word was with
God, He was amongst us, the God-man. Bang! The God-man. He was in Palestine. We
ate with Him, we touched Him, we saw Him risen from the dead. He encouraged us, we
spoke with Him, we knew Him for three years. Boom, boom, boom. No vagueness.
Absolute clarity, historical facts. Saint John slams facts into the face of the
Gnostics. It is not vague, not specialized knowledge. He was a carpenter, amongst
us fishermen. The Word of God came right down to earth. We handled Him, touched
Him, heard Him. This is the concreteness and practicality of Catholicism, not some
vague intellectual theory.

The false intellectualization of Christianity was beginning, and therefore, the
purpose of the Book of the Apocalypse is to fight Gnosticism.

The Catholic faith was also wilting in expectation of the second coming (see
Second Thessalonians). The Apocalypse teaches that persecutions will pass; Christ
and His Church will triumph. Catholics often need to remember this because it does
not always look like it is healing. It teaches the meaning of history: evil is
always attacking the Church; Christians suffer but win. Today, Catholics know all
about suffering; it is tough, and they really need encouragement. Christians
suffer but win.

Any questions on addressees and purpose?

## Textual Basis

What manuscripts do we have?

There are 253 manuscripts dating from the 10th to the 17th centuries. Perhaps one
or two are still being discovered. It seems there is not a really ancient
manuscript, for some reason.

## Theological Teaching of the Book of the Apocalypse

The book is the Word of God, inspired, dealing with supernatural truths. What does
it tell us? We put them in classical order: 1. God, 2. Christ, 3. Holy Ghost, 4.
Angels, 5. Church, 6. Last things.

### 1. On God

The Apocalypse, being a message of hope, underlines God's omnipotence. It
emphasizes the power of God over all history, His power to rescue Christians and
make them triumph despite the worst that the world, the flesh, and the devil can
throw at the Church.

### 2. On Christ

He is presented in triumph as man but the equal of God. He is the God-man.

*   **He is Son of God**: (Apoc. 2:18, 1:6, 14:1).
*   **He has divine attributes**: (Apoc. 2:23, 1:18, 3:21).
*   **He receives divine worship**: (Apoc. 20:6).
*   **He receives divine titles**: (Apoc. 1:17, 2:8 [corrected from 2:18 in speech, as 2:8 fits "the first and the last"], 22:13).
    *   Apoc. 22:13: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the
        beginning and the end."
    *   Apoc. 1:18: "And alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever and
        ever, and have the keys of death and of hell."
    *   Apoc. 3:7: "These things saith the Holy One and the true one, he that hath
        the key of David; he that openeth, and no man shutteth; shutteth, and no
        man openeth."
    *   Apoc. 21:6: "And he said to me: It is done. I am Alpha and Omega; the
        beginning and the end."
    *   Apoc. 17:14: "These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
        them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings."
    *   Apoc. 19:13: "And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood; and
        his name is called, THE WORD OF GOD."

Christ is also man.

*   Apoc. 1:13: "And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the
    Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps
    with a golden girdle."
*   Apoc. 14:14: "Son of man."

So He is God with all kinds of divine attributes and titles, and He is also man.

Lastly, above all, He is Lamb (L-A-M-B). Saint Thomas Aquinas says the lamb is the
most complete type of Christ in the Old Testament.

*   **Delivering us from sin**: Apoc. 1:5: "...who hath loved us, and washed us
    from our sins in his own blood."
*   **Redeeming us**: Apoc. 5:9: "And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art
    worthy, O Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou
    wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and
    tongue, and people, and nation."
*   **Sanctifying us**: Apoc. 5:10: "And hast made us to our God a kingdom and
    priests; and we shall reign on the earth."
*   **Triumphant in heaven**: Apoc. 5:6: "And I saw: and behold in the midst of the
    throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a
    Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are
    the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth."
*   **Saving us**: Apoc. 12:11, 19:7-9.

### 3. On the Holy Ghost

Primo, God. Secundo, Christ. Tertio, Holy Ghost. Oh, I will not start on that.
Tertio, Holy Ghost.
