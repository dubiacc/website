Bishop Williamson deciphers Revelation chapters 5 and 6, linking the Lamb's
heavenly glory to the Church's historical trials as revealed through the seven seals,
from apostolic zeal to modern apostasy.

# Apocalypse 5 & 6: The Lamb, the Seals, and the Ages of the Church

Bishop Williamson explains that Revelation chapter 5 shows the Lamb, once humiliated
on Earth but now glorified in Heaven, as uniquely worthy to open the scroll due to
His redemptive sacrifice. He says this worthiness, characterized by power, divinity,
and honor, directly contrasts His earthly suffering. 

Transitioning to chapter 6, he interprets the seven seals as distinct eras in Church history. 

1. White horse: the apostolic Church's spiritual conquest;
2. Red horse: as the age of bloody persecutions by the Roman Empire
3. Black horse: as the rise of heresies, where simple faith still accesses true Scripture despite corruption
4. Pale horse: An age of hypocritical, superficial Christianity, linking its "rotten insides" to Rousseau's
pernicious influence and modern apostasy
5. Fifth seal: Martyrs' glory
6. Sixth seal: Antichrist's triumph
7. Seventh seal: Eternal Beatitude

## Commentary on Revelation Chapter 5: The Worthiness of the Lamb

Verse 10: "Thou hast made us for our God a kingdom and priests,
and we shall reign over the Earth." We shall dominate the world, the flesh, and the
devil. Not that we shall have some kind of empire, but we shall dominate the world,
the flesh, and the devil—in other words, a spiritual victory, a spiritual kingdom.

The 24 elders were chanting the song of verse nine: "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to
take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast
redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and
nation. And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign
over the earth." It is a great spiritual kingdom that the Lamb has created, a
spiritual victory.

Verse 11: "And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne,
and the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was thousands of
thousands." "Thousands of thousands" stands for innumerable millions.

Verse 12: "Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive
power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
benediction." The Lamb by His death is worthy to receive praise. Remember what was
said at the time: He was a revolutionary, a carpenter, a madman. He was crushed
like a worm, the scorn of everybody, dying on a gibbet, accursed.

We are now getting the list of what He really was, in contrast to what He was made
out to be at the time. He was portrayed as a carpenter from Nazareth, a revolutionary
who stirred up crowds, a fanatic. It was said He wasn't "macho," followed only by
women and children. Now, the truth is presented:
His virtue (*virtutem*), because many said He was a revolutionary and mocked His
virtue, so He is worthy to receive praise for His very real virtue.
His divinity, because many said He was simply a provincial, backwoods carpenter
from Nazareth.
Wisdom, because He was dressed up and mocked as a madman at the court of Herod.
Strength, because He was crushed like a worm, appearing weak and defeated.
Honor, because shame was heaped upon Him. Stripped naked and hung on a gibbet,
covered in shame, therefore He deserves honor.
Glory, because He died an infamous death like a criminal.
This is the truth; the 24 elders know the truth about the Lamb, as opposed to His
appearance on Earth.

Finally, blessing, because it is written, "Cursed is he that hangs upon a tree."
This is found in Galatians 3:13, where St. Paul, quoting Deuteronomy 21:23, writes:
"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for
it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree)." So Our Lord appeared
cursed, as the Old Testament stated (Deuteronomy 21:23), but in fact, He was
blessed. This is the mystery of the Cross.

Verse 13: "And every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them: I heard all saying: To
him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory,
and power, for ever and ever." Now the Lamb receives all due glory, whereas on earth
He received shame and derision. "To him that sitteth on the throne" refers to God,
Three in One. "And to the Lamb" refers to the humanity of Christ. Thus, they
proclaim: "Benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever."

Verse 14: "And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty elders
fell down on their faces, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever."

This concludes chapter 5. It is quite mysterious, but commentators like Dom Mollat
unlock the symbols at their own level, without delving into speculative applications.

## The Seven Seals: Unveiling Church History (Revelation Chapter 6)

In chapter 6, the interpretation begins to apply to the history of the Church.
Chapters 6, 7, and the first verse of chapter 8 describe the opening of the seven
seals, which represent the history of the Church. Chapter 6 contains the first five
seals and the first part of the sixth seal. Chapter 7 details the remainder of the
sixth seal. Chapter 8, verse 1, presents the seventh seal.

The first four seals introduce the famous Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The fifth
seal concerns the appeal of the saints. The sixth seal involves the shaking of the
heavens and the signing of the elect (12,000 from each tribe). Each of the seven
seals portrays an important stage in the history of the Church.

The first seal is the birth of the Church setting out to conquer the world (the
white horse). The second, third, and fourth seals represent successive persecutions.
The history of the Church is one of persecutions, including the very clever
persecution today by churchmen themselves, who are used to destroy the Church.
For example, there are arguments that the Tridentine Mass should be, at most, a
sentimental appendix to the "great chariot" of Vatican II—a magnificent mobile home,
with the Tridentine Mass as a miserable, rinky-dink antique trailing behind the
Novus Ordo Church. This is presented as its sole function.

The fifth seal (chapter 6, verse 9) is the glory of the martyrs. The sixth seal
(verse 12) signifies the triumph of the Antichrist: "And I saw, when he had opened
the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as
sackcloth of hair..." The seventh seal (chapter 8, verse 1) is the beginning of
eternal beatitude: "there was silence in heaven, as it were for half an hour." This
seal is just one verse before the vision of the seven trumpets begins.

### The First Seal: The White Horse – The Apostolic Church

Chapter 6, verse 1-2: "And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals,
and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of thunder,
saying: Come and see. And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him
had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that he
might conquer." This is the opening of the first seal.

The call "Come" means, "Come towards the mysteries instead of fleeing from them as
most men do, and you will see." John is invited to pay attention to the vision.
Let us examine this: "And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him
had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that he
might conquer."

The white horse: Irenaeus says it is Christ. Others say it represents the first
preachers of the Gospel, the Apostles, who flung themselves like noble warhorses
into the battles of God. This latter interpretation is preferred here, with Christ
as the horseman. The Apostle is seen as a noble horse, flinging himself into God's
battles (compare Job 39:20-26). The horse is a noble animal, readily going into war.

The color white signifies the purity of early Christian morals. If Christ is not the
horse, then Christ guiding the Apostles is the horseman on the white horse.
"And he that sat on him had a bow." The bow is Scripture, a weapon like a two-edged
sword.
"And there was a crown given him." The crown signifies the right to rule over the
whole world, the sovereignty of Christ the King.
"And he went forth" (*exivit*). He went forth from Judaism with the Apostles. This
relates to the Council of Jerusalem (c. 49 AD) and Christianity breaking out of
Judaism, a theme prominent in the Epistle to the Galatians. He went forth from
Jewry, "conquering that he might conquer"—conquering the world, the flesh, and the
devil, in order to conquer souls for Heaven. This is the portrait of the early Church.

### The Second Seal: The Red Horse – Persecution by Bloodshed

The devil reacts in the next seal. Verse 3-4: "And when he had opened the second
seal, I heard the second living creature, saying: Come and see. And there went out
another horse that was red: and to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should
take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another, and a great sword
was given to him."

The red horse signifies the bloody persecutions of the Church—the second age of the
Church, the Age of Martyrs. This corresponds to historical periods, from Nero to
Diocletian (the ten persecutions). The horseman on the red horse is the devil,
receiving commission to take peace away and permission to slaughter, thereby showing
forth the virtue of the Christians.

Those martyrs are a glory of the Church; their sacrifice led to the moral and
spiritual conquering of the Roman Empire, achieved without swords. This is always
God's way of conquering, not the world's. There is no use hoping to conquer by the
media today; such a victory would be worthless.

It is quite possible that future victory will also come through persecution or a
divine intervention. God will not act without human cooperation. Souls from all
quarters will respond when God intervenes, hopefully a higher proportion from among
traditional Catholics, but also from elsewhere: "Other sheep I have, that are not of
this fold: them also I must bring" (John 10:16). Yet, there will always be traitors
from unexpected quarters. Let him that thinketh himself to stand, take heed lest he
fall (1 Corinthians 10:12). The following verse (10:13) assures us: "Let no
temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not
suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with
temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it."

So, the horseman on the red horse (symbolizing blood and persecutions) is the
devil. The phrase "that they should kill one another" refers to mutual killing,
which we see today and will see more of. Compare Matthew 10:21-22: "The brother
also shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children
shall rise up against their parents, and shall put them to death. And you shall be
hated by all men for my name's sake: but he that shall persevere unto the end, he
shall be saved."

"And a great sword was given to him." The great sword was the secular power of the
Roman Empire, turned upon the Christians from Nero onwards. Humanly speaking, they
were crushed, but as Tertullian said, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the
Church." (Tertullian, a brilliant mind, later fell into the Montanist heresy).

### The Third Seal: The Black Horse – Persecution by Heresy

The great sword, then, is the Roman Empire's power used against Christians. Since
the blood of martyrs was the seed of the Church, the devil changed tactics for the
third horseman. Verse 5-6: "And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the
third living creature saying: Come and see. And behold a black horse. And he that
sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard as it were a voice in the
midst of the four living creatures saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and
thrice two pounds of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil."
What does this mean?

The black horse represents heresy. The third age of the Church (c. 313-500 AD),
following the bloody persecutions, was the age of the Doctors, as it was also an age
of great heresies. The devil shifted from persecution by blood to persecution by
heresy. Black signifies the blocking out of light and grace.

"And he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand." This horseman is the
heretic, who weighs and judges all things for himself, deciding what he will and
will not believe, instead of docilely following Tradition and the Fathers.

Verse 6: "And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures
saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two pounds of barley for a penny,
and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil." The voice from "amidst the four living
creatures" (the Gospels) is Mother Church, reassuring the faithful.

The "penny" represents simple, trusting faith. For this "penny," one receives "two
pounds of wheat"—the literal and mystical senses of the perfect wheat of the New
Testament. The commentators drawn upon here, like Dom Mollat, are often medieval,
situated between the Fathers and modern Scripture scholars. For the penny of simple
faith, one also receives "thrice two pounds of barley." Barley signifies the
rougher Old Testament. "Thrice two pounds" refers to the literal and mystical
senses of its three divisions: the Law, the History, and the Prophets.

"And see thou hurt not the wine and the oil." The devil is not to corrupt the force
(wine) and sweetness (oil) of Scripture. Though heretics will try to corrupt
Scripture, Mother Church will protect its true meaning. Provided people keep their
simple faith, they can always draw upon Scripture for the true Word of God and the
mind of the Church, protecting them from heretics.

A major part of Modernism was the corruption of Scripture by rationalist exegetes
who deny miracles and God. The falsification of liturgy played a huge part in
Neo-Modernism, while Scripture falsification was common to both.

### The Fourth Seal: The Pale Horse – Persecution by Hypocrisy

After heretics, the fourth persecution is by hypocrites or false brethren. This
corresponds somewhat to the fourth age of the Church. The first three seals align
well with the first three ages of the Church, but this correspondence becomes less
exact from the fourth seal onwards.

The fourth persecution is the fourth horse. Verse 7-8: "And when he had opened the
fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature, saying: Come and see.
And behold a pale horse, and he that sat upon him, his name was Death, and hell
followed him. And power was given unto him over the four parts of the earth, to kill
with sword, with famine, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth." This is
Death, one of the famed Four Horsemen.

This horse is "pale" (verse 8). "Pale" signifies appearing white or stainless, but
not truly so—an "off-white." It represents an imitation of Christian purity, thus,
hypocrisy. This is the fourth persecution: looking Christian in appearance, but not
in reality.

The age of hypocrisy can be linked to the fifth age of the Church, the age of
apostasy, which is our current age. After a thousand years of Christendom
established that being Christian is good, many now pretend to be Christian but do
not live up to it, preferring to go their own way.

This is key to understanding Rousseau. He provided an age weary of Christianity's
demands with a sentimental, sensual content under a Christian veneer. This sold like
hotcakes because people, particularly in the corrupt 18th century, wanted to fall
away from their noble heritage. Such an age listens to those who allow them to
pretend to be Christian while acting otherwise. This results in an appearance of
Catholicism with a rotten core. This is seen today in Modernism and Neo-Modernism:
rotten, sentimental, sensual, corrupt insides under a virtuous appearance, which
people embrace—like "The Sound of Music" phenomenon.

This is Rousseau, who had an enormous influence. Dr. Koinowski identified Rousseau
as the number one error, encompassing the denial of original sin, the pretense that
everything is lovely and nice, and a sticky, gooey sentimentality. It sells because
people love the idea that everyone is nice and sweet. Rousseau himself exemplified
this: claiming innocence while abandoning his five children to a workhouse, then
writing a book on child education without practicing his principles. His beautiful
French prose is another of his seductions.

Similarly, Luther wrote beautiful German; his Bible translation was foundational
for modern German. The devil gives beautiful style to his servants, but the content
is rotten. Conversely, God's servants, like St. Thomas Aquinas, may prioritize
profound content over polished style. Rousseau's attractive style is part of his
seduction. He is sick, and our age, steeped in this "feely-feely" sentimentality, is
sick. Rousseau's influence is linked to the denial of original sin, the totalitarian
state, and Modernism. It is incredible.

Understanding Rousseau provides a real handle on understanding the modern world.
