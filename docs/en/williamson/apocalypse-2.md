Interpreting passages from the Book of Apocalypse 2, Bishop Williamson connects the
messages to the Churches of Smyrna, Pergamum, and Thyatira with distinct ages of Church
history and their spiritual conditions.

# Apocalypse 2: The Churches of Smyrna, Pergamum, and Thyatira

Bishop Williamson explains that the Church of Smyrna represents the Age of Martyrs
(70-313 AD), praised for spiritual richness despite persecution, and warned of
blasphemy from the 'synagogue of Satan.' 

He clarifies that its members are urged to be faithful unto death to receive the 
'crown of life' and avoid the 'second death.' Bishop Williamson notes that the 
Church of Pergamum, corresponding to the Age of Doctors (313-500 AD), is commended 
for faith amidst paganism but criticized for tolerating the doctrines of Balaam and 
the Nicolaitans. 

He details God's word as a 'two-edged sword,' urging penance and promising 'hidden manna' 
and a 'white stone' to conquerors. Bishop Williamson asserts that the Church of Thyatira, 
representing a thousand years of Christian civilization (500-1517 AD), was led by a bishop lacking
fortitude, tolerating 'Jezebel' as a symbol of sensual softness and heresy. He
recounts historical upsets, explains the symbolism of Christ's attributes, warns of
judgment against Jezebel's followers unless they repent, and discusses God's searching
of 'reins and hearts,' linking this to his views on certain modern-day crimes as
'signature murders.'

## The Church of Smyrna: The Age of Martyrs

We are in Chapter 2, verse nine: "I know thy tribulation and thy
poverty, but thou art rich and thou art blasphemed." This refers to the Church of Smyrna,
not the Church of Sardis, as I mistakenly first said. It is the Church of Smyrna.

This church is under persecution, corresponding to the second age of the Church,
the Age of Martyrs, from 70 AD to around 313 AD. The date 313 AD is suggested for the
Battle of the Milvian Bridge. So, 70 to 313 AD marks the second age of the Church, the
Age of the Martyrs.

### Tribulation and Spiritual Riches

"I know thy tribulation and thy poverty." For this Church of Smyrna, there are no
reproaches. This is because one does not criticize somebody who is having a hard time.
It is a principle, as in the spiritual exercises: if a retreatant is being
particularly hard-pressed by the devil, you would offer encouragement.
"Poverty" here is as the world judges, but this Church is "rich in spiritual goods,"
obviously. "I know thy tribulation and thy poverty"—that is poverty as the world
judges—"but thou art rich in spiritual goods."

### The Synagogue of Satan

And, "Thou art blasphemed by those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are the
synagogue of Satan." Synagogue means assembly, a bringing together, a leading
together, much like a pedagogue is a leader of children. So, it is an assembly of Satan.
Compare this with John 8:39-44, the terrible words of Our Lord to the Jews who
pretended to be the children of Abraham, the children of Moses, but were spiritually
nothing of the kind.

### Exhortation to Faithfulness and the Crown of Life

"Fear nothing of all thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to send some
of you to prison in order for you to be put to the trial, and you will have tribulation
for 10 days." Ten days signifies a brief duration. Why ten? It represents the time of
this life when man is under the yoke of the Ten Commandments. So, ten days means just a
brief time, because this life is brief. *Vita brevis*—this life is brief. You
youngsters do not know how brief it is. You will learn. If you grow old enough, you
will learn. If you do not grow old enough, you will have proved how brief it is. If you
do grow old enough, you will learn how brief it is. It is the time of man's life under
the yoke of the Ten Commandments.

"And you will have tribulation for 10 days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will
give you the crown of life." The crown of life is the possession of God in eternal
bliss.

### The Second Death

"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." Again, each
message to a single church is really for all seven churches; it is for the whole
Church, for all Christians. Chapters 2 and 3 are a treatise of the spiritual life.
"He that will have conquered"—the future perfect, he who shall have conquered—"will not
be harmed by the second death." The second death is eternal damnation. The first death
is when body and soul separate; the second death is when the soul is flung into
eternal damnation.

## The Church of Pergamum: The Age of Doctors

The third church is the Church of Pergamum. It is the letter to a church infested with
idolatry and threatened by multiple heresies. Pergamum corresponds to the gift of
science, to keep true doctrine by the Word of God, which is a two-edged sword (verse 12).

### The Two-Edged Sword and the Gift of Science

Compare Apocalypse 1, verse 16, and Hebrews 4, verse 12. A two-edged sword, as the
commentary says—this commentary being a synthesis of classic authors, the Church
Fathers and medieval commentators. It draws from the tradition of the Church Fathers.
The sources mentioned are Albert the Great, Richard of Saint Victor, Rupert of Deutz,
Winfrid Strabon, Thomas of England, and fundamentally, Dennis the Carthusian. The Word
of God is like a two-edged sword because it cuts very differently for the good and for
the bad. A sharp, two-edged sword.

### Historical Context: The Age of Doctors (313-500 AD)

This third letter corresponds to the Age of Doctors, the third age of the Church, from
approximately 313 AD to about 500 AD. This period in Church history is the age of
Saint John Chrysostom, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, Saint Basil, Saint Gregory of
Nyssa, Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, and Saint Athanasius. I also mentioned Jerome and
Augustine, of course, and Saint Ambrose. All of those doctors fall within that period.
The reason is that as the Church came out of persecution, the devil had to change
tactics. Instead of throwing physical lions at the Church, he threw intellectual lions—
in other words, persecution by heresy. Instead of persecution by blood, it was
persecution by heresy. Therefore, instead of the answer by martyrs, the answer came
from doctors. So, the third age of the Church, 313 to 500 AD, is the Age of Doctors.
It corresponds to the Church of Pergamum.

### Commendation: Holding Fast the Faith

First, the compliments, the *captatio benevolentiae*. "I know where thou dwellest,
where the seat of Satan is, and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith,
even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where
Satan dwelleth" (verse 13).
In a city filled with pagan temples, emperor worship, and false cults—which was the
character of the ancient city of Pergamum—it is especially praiseworthy to have kept
the faith. "I know where thou dwellest." I know what a hard time you are having keeping
the faith in the place where you live. It is a seat of Satan. "And thou holdest my name
and hast not denied my faith." So that is praiseworthy.

### Antipas, the Faithful Witness

"Even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness who was slain among you, where
Satan dwelleth." Antipas, according to tradition, was a previous bishop, burned alive
inside a bronze bull—a pleasant kind of death. When Antipas taught Christian doctrine,
people would likely shout, "Bull bronze, bull bronze!" as a threat, indicating what
faced him. He was burned alive inside a bull of bronze. I'll wager he now remembers
"bull bronze." From hours of sacred doctrine on the Apocalypse, one of the few things
you might remember is "bull bronze." Just wait and see.

Notice, there are satanized cities; scripture is saying so. There is such a thing as
satanized cities. Paris is today a satanized city, likely with many Black Masses.
London, one could say, has been satanized for a long time.

### Criticism: The Doctrine of Balaam and the Nicolaitans

But, verse 14: "But I have against thee a few things, because thou hast there them
that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the
children of Israel to eat and to commit fornication. So hast thou also them that hold
the doctrine of the Nicolaites."
So, we move into the criticism. Balaam (see Numbers chapters 22 to 24, Jude verse 11)
was the pagan prophet who advised the pagan king, Balak, to conquer the Israelites by
corrupting their morals. This is why the communists are tremendous promoters of
pornography and rock music amongst their adversaries, though not amongst themselves.
Communists always kept those things strictly under control in communist countries, but
they heavily promoted them in their enemies' countries to rot the West from inside.
Balak asked, "How can I beat these people? They're unbeatable. God is always on their
side." The answer was, "Well, stop God being on their side. Make them sin against their
God, and then you will beat them easily." Diabolical, very clever advice.
This is very much what is happening today. If God is on their side, all you need to do
is get God to stop being on their side, by making them break the commandments (Numbers
25:1-2, Numbers 31:16).

In this case, the Balaamites are the Nicolaites—those who follow the doctrine of Deacon
Nicholas, which amounted to sensuality, better known today as S-E-X. This deacon
either gave away his own wife or taught free love to cover up his own life.

### Call to Penance

"So thou too hast those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites. Likewise, do penance,
lest I come quickly to you and fight with them with the sword of my mouth. In like
manner, do penance. If not, I will come to thee quickly and will fight against them
with the sword of my mouth." With the sword means with words of absolute authority,
cutting words, convicting of sin and destroying excuses. Compare the punishment of the
Israelites in Numbers 21:7.

### Promises to the Conqueror: Hidden Manna and the White Stone

"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To he who
conquers, to the one conquering, I will give hidden manna." Hidden manna is Christ
beneath the sacramental species, so it seems to be in this life rather than in the next.
"And I will give him a white stone," a white counter, or *calculum*, a small stone.
"And in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it."
A white counter is a brilliant, impassable, risen body—shining white, unable to
suffer.
"And on the stone, a new name written which nobody knows except he who receives it." The
impassable risen body, brilliant and unable to suffer, is a reward for remaining chaste
against the Nicolaitans. A new name signifies a renewed soul, a new personality,
enjoying a peace and harmony unknown in this life, except to him who enjoys it. There
is the peace that passeth all understanding, a Christian joy of which the world has no
idea.

## The Church of Thyatira: A Bishop Lacking Fortitude

The fourth church is Thyatira. The fourth letter is to a bishop lacking the energy to
practice fraternal correction. It corresponds to the gift of fortitude, that strength
which this bishop is lacking.

### The Gift of Fortitude and Fraternal Correction (Eli's Sons)

Compare 1 Samuel chapters two to four. Can anyone explain this? Webber suggests it is
about the old priest, Eli, who did not correct his sons, who were doing something wrong
with the sacrifice. Yes, that is right. The sons of Eli were priests, and what was
their sin? They interfered with the sacrifice. Their sin was to make the people give to
them what should be given to God, and therefore the people became disgusted with the
sacrifice. It was a serious sin. They were priests, and their sin was keeping people
away from the sacrifice. This has parallels with the 20th century Novus Ordo.

In the Tanakh, these books are 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings (sometimes referred
to as 3 Kings and 4 Kings to avoid confusion). In 1 Samuel (or 1 Kings in some Bibles)
chapter two, verse 13 and following describes their sin: "The sons of Eli were children
of Belial, not knowing the Lord, nor the office of the priests to the people. But
whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came while the flesh was
in boiling, with a flesh hook of three teeth in his hand, and thrust it into the
kettle, or into the cauldron, or into the pot, or into the pan. And all that the flesh
hook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to
Shiloh." So, these two sons came with a three-pronged fork, fished in everyone's
sacrifice, and whatever they came up with belonged to them instead of to God.
Verse 17 states: "Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the
Lord, because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord." Notice that verse, 1
Kings 2:17. It is well worth noticing. That is the sin of the Novus Ordo. The sin is
exceeding great because it keeps people away from the sacrifice of the Lord. To fool
around with the Mass in such a way as to stop people offering the real sacrifice or
taking part in the real sacrifice to God is a very serious sin.

So, here is a bishop of the fourth church who lacks the fortitude to practice
fraternal correction. He is a priest, but he will not tell people what they should do.

### Historical Context: The Age of Christian Civilization (500-1517 AD)

This corresponds to the fourth age of the Church, from about 500 AD to 1517 AD, the
1,000 years of Christian civilization, of Catholic civilization, in which Mother Church
was the tranquil moral mistress of civilization. Nevertheless, there were two major
upsets during those 1,000 years.

#### Upsets in the Fourth Age: Mohammedanism

One major upset was Mohammedanism. In the late 500s, early 600s, there was the
ravaging of all African Christianity and a good part of Middle Eastern, African, and
even Spanish Christendom by the arrival of the Muslims. The Muslims penetrated right up
into France until the French pushed them back at the Battle of Poitiers. This was waged
by Charles Martel in 732 AD. The Mohammedans came right through Spain, thanks, among
other things, to the friendship of the Jews. The Jews betrayed Spain to the enemies of
Christ. And the Jews are now working hand-in-hand with their archenemies, the Muslims,
to betray France today. The Jews and the Muslims are allied against whatever is still
left of Christian France. And who is principally responsible for that state of affairs?
The apostate Catholics. That is the real problem. The Jews loathe the Muslims, but when
it comes to fighting against Christ, the Jews will gladly work together with anybody.

#### Upsets in the Fourth Age: The Dark Ages and the Albigensian Heresy

Another upset was the Dark Ages, the 800s and 900s. Then, in the 1100s, there was the
Albigensian Heresy of the Cathars. If you drive through that part of France, you see
tourist signs: "You are entering into Cathar country." You might drive past famous
Cathar castles and see monuments to them by the roadside, absolutely ugly monuments.
The devil is doing what he likes. Unbelievable, commemorations of the Cathars, a
horrible heresy. Saint Dominic conquered it by means of the Rosary.

### Divine Attributes: Eyes of Flame, Feet of Brass

Verse 18: "These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire and
feet like to fine brass."

#### Digression: Brass vs. Bronze

What is the difference between brass and bronze? Someone suggests bronze is made of
copper. Another says both have copper. Ron explains: The main component of bronze is
copper and tin, though it can have other additions. The main component of brass is
copper. He mentions he had to do some research. As for properties, bronze is said to be
harder, while brass may be stronger. Bronze is not as hard as steel, its luster is not
as strong, but it has a nice color.
The Latin is *aurichalcum*, which is like golden brass. So, His feet are like golden
brass. The brass has gold mixed into it. Ronald suggests both alloys can have various
metals for different shades and colors. Gold always represents charity. Brass
represents toughness or resistance. In the north of England, "brass" means money.

His eyes are like a flame to penetrate, illumine, enlighten, and enflame.

### Commendation: Works, Faith, Charity, Patience

Verse 19: "I know Thy works, and Thy faith, and Thy charity, and Thy ministry, and Thy
patience, and Thy last works which are more than the former." This is the praise from
the all-knowing God. There is nearly always something to praise; they have not gotten
everything wrong. It is a classic principle to state what is good, as well as what is
bad. But...

### Criticism: Tolerating the Woman Jezebel

Verse 20 marks the criticism: "But I have against thee a few things, because thou
sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce
my servants to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed to idols. And I gave
her time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her fornication. Behold,
I will cast her into a bed, and they that committed adultery with her shall be in very
great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds. And I will kill her
children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the
reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works."

#### Jezebel as Symbol of Sensual Softness and Heresy

Jezebel could possibly be the bishop's own wife (Saint Paul says a bishop should be a
man of one wife). Possibly she represents some other Nicolaitans, a pseudo-prophetess,
or perhaps just a symbol of heretics, as she was a terrible creature in the third book
of Kings (see 3 Kings 18:4, 19:2, 21:5ff).
In the moral sense, Jezebel here represents sensual softness slipping in amongst
Christians due to a lack of the pastor's vigilance. This is what we would call S-E-X
today. Pope Pius XII appealed not to use that word, remarking that it is a very
debasing word for what it represents. The reproductive process is a dignified and noble
creation of God in itself, but "sex" is a vulgar word for it. The word degrades the
thing, Pius XII more or less said, obviously because the act so often involves sin. But
that is not a reason to degrade it with such a word. Pius XII was Pope from 1939 to
1958.

#### God's Call to Penance and Jezebel's Obstinacy

"And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her
fornication." Notice human free will and human obstinacy. God gives her time to do
penance (free will), and she will not repent (obstinacy).

#### Judgment on Jezebel and Her Followers

"Behold, I will cast her into a bed"—this means death. "They that committed adultery
with her shall be in very great tribulation"—this refers to the fires of hell. "And I
will kill her children with death." Compare 4 Kings 10:7, where Jehu, avenging God's
judgment on Ahab and Jezebel, had Ahab's 70 sons killed. Jehu wrote letters saying, "If
you will be mine and will obey me, take the heads of the sons of your master and come
to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time." The chief men of the city took the king's sons,
slew 70 persons, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu. So, "I will kill
her children" is a reference back to this Old Testament event. Jezebel herself could
not have had 70 sons, but these were perhaps all sons of Ahab.

### God Searches Reins and Hearts

"And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he
that searcheth the reins and hearts." "Reins" is French; the modern English word is
kidneys. I am the one that sounds out the kidneys. Apparently, the kidneys are well
buried in the lower part of our trunk, and it takes a good surgeon to find and remove
one.

#### Digression: Jack the Ripper and Masonic Murders

This was one of the features of Jack the Ripper. I reread a book on this recently—for
purely intellectual interest, of course. In the fourth or fifth murder, the murderer
sent one of the victim's kidneys to the police to mock them. This was a clue suggesting
Jack the Ripper must have been a surgeon or doctor, as not just anyone could extract a
kidney from a corpse.
Indeed, Jack the Ripper was actually a team of three: a famous artist named Walter
Sickert, one of Queen Victoria's surgeons, Sir William Gull, and a coachman. The
coachman drove the coach; the artist would approach the woman, who would get into the
cab; they would feed the victim grapes laced with something to put her to sleep; then
the surgeon would kill and mutilate her, and they would lay her body back on the
pavement and drive off.
Recently, someone sent me a Freemasonic essay denying any Masonic involvement with Jack
the Ripper. To my mind, the book I read is absolutely convincing, and it seems highly
likely, if not certain, that they were Masonic murders. It is typical that Masons are
still trying to cover this up or confuse the issue. They were Masonic murders because
the Masons were protecting the royal family from a scandal. When these poor women in
the East End of London tried to blackmail the royal family, the Masons closed in and
killed them sensationally to signal to anyone involved, "We Masons are in control.
Don't mess with us." When one corpse was found, three pennies were arranged in a
triangle, a Masonic sign. These were what Malachi Martin calls "signature murders."

#### Digression: The Murder of Father Kunz and Signature Murders

Just like the priest killed recently in Wisconsin, Father Kunz. It was a signature
murder. His body was mutilated in a particular way to tell those in the know, "This was
done by us. Don't mess with us." They still have not found the murderers in Wisconsin.
The police said it was probably someone local who knew Father Kunz's habits and to whom
he would open the door. If it was Satanists, as the signature mutilations seem to
indicate, they will probably not be found by the police, quote unquote. They "won't be
found" because they are too highly placed—local architects, doctors, very respectable
citizens, but secret Satanists. Faggotry might also come into it because Father Kunz was
onto their case. My sheer guess, though I don't really know, is that it is more likely
Satanists, given the characteristic mutilations.
