Bishop Williamson deciphers Revelation's prophecies of Christ's victory over evil
and offers timeless guidance for navigating spiritual battles in the modern age.

# Apocalypse 19-20: Christ's Victory and Satan's Defeat

Bishop Williamson explains that Apocalypse Chapter 19 reveals Christ's judgment on
the Antichrist, where His Word is a two-edged sword. He says Christians should
beware material prosperity, recalling Deuteronomy, and understand Christ's
kingship through both divine inheritance and conquest by the Cross. Bishop
Williamson further describes the "great supper of God" as the eternal wedding
feast, symbolizing the conversion of nations. 

Turning to Chapter 20, he shows that the devil's binding for a "thousand years" 
signifies the period from Christ's Passion until the Antichrist, a time when 
salvation is accessible. He notes Leo XIII's vision of Satan's increased power 
in modern times and imparts Archbishop Lefebvre's counsel on spiritual warfare: 
emphasizing caution, the supreme power of the Mass, and the importance of 
confession and prayer against demonic influence.

## Interpreting Apocalypse Chapter 19: Condemnation of the Antichrist

(Transcript starts): We are looking at Apocalypse chapter 19, verse 15. Chapter 18
was the condemnation of the damned. Chapter 19 is the condemnation of the
Antichrist. Chapter 20, the condemnation of the devil. And then chapters 21 and
22 are the upbeat conclusion: the celestial vision, the glorification of the
saints, and the splendors of Heavenly Jerusalem.

Verse 15: "And from his mouth proceeds a sword sharp on both sides, in order
with it to strike the nations. And he will rule them with an iron rod, and he
himself treads the wine press of the fury of the anger of Almighty God."

### The Two-Edged Sword and the Rod of Iron

The sword is the Word of God issuing from the Savior's mouth, two-edged to prune
the good and to cut off the wicked. Material prosperity is sometimes a curse, and
material affliction is sometimes a blessing. It all depends upon who is on the
receiving end and why. Material affliction can be a blessing if it prunes, if it
cuts somebody off from pride, temptation, or corruption. On the other hand,
material prosperity can be a curse if it exposes people to those things, as it
does for many people today.

I am fond of quoting Deuteronomy, chapter 8. Moses says to the Jews, "Watch out
for material prosperity." Verse 8 reads: "For the Lord thy God will bring thee
into a good land of brooks, and of waters, and of fountains, in the plains of
which and the hills deep rivers break out, a land of wheat and barley and
vineyards, wherein fig trees and pomegranates and olive yards grow, a land of oil
and honey. Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread and enjoy abundance
of all things, where the stones are iron and out of hills are dug mines of brass,
that when thou hast eaten and art full, thou mayest bless the Lord thy God for
the excellent land which He has given thee. Take heed and beware lest at any time
thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect His commands and judgments and
ceremonies which I command thee this day. Lest after thou hast eaten and art
filled, has built goodly houses and dwelt in them, and you have plenty of gold,
plenty of oxen, plenty of all these things, lest thy heart be lifted up, and thou
remember not the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondage, and who led you through it and fed thee in the wilderness.
Lest thou should say in thine heart," verse 17, "'My own might and the strength
of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.' But remember the Lord thy
God, that He hath given thee strength. If thou forget the Lord thy God and follow
strange gods and serve them, behold now, I foretell thee, that thou shalt utterly
perish. As the nations which the Lord destroyed at their entrance, so shall you
also perish if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God."

So, watch out for prosperity, as Deuteronomy Chapter 8 warns, because it can be
dangerous. A lot has happened in today's world since the Second World War. The
Second World War was material affliction that did a lot of people a lot of good,
spiritually speaking. But then people got away from the post-war years and into
prosperity, and that prosperity has done a lot of people a lot of damage.
So, the sword is two-edged, to prune the good as well as cut off the wicked.

The rod of iron represents the inflexibility of the law of God, unbending even for
good men. The very least failings must be repented or purged in purgatory. Our
Lord may rule with a rod of iron because He Himself took the full anger of God
upon Himself. He Himself will rule the nations with a rod of iron, almost because
He Himself has trod the wine press of the fury of the anger of Almighty God.
Our Lord will rule with a rod of iron, the unbending law of God, because He
Himself has faced the full anger of God. And He has upon His clothing and on His
thigh inscribed "King of Kings and Lord of Lords."

### Christ's Double Title to Kingship

He also may rule with a rod of iron because His divine right is hypostatically
stamped upon His human nature. Psalm 71:10-11 says: "The kings of Tharsis, and the
islands shall offer presents. The kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring
gifts: and all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him."
So again, it is the double title of Our Lord. One, He has all rights because He is
God. Two, He has all rights because He earned them by dying upon the cross as man.
So, He is Christ the King by a double title: a title of inheritance from God the
Father, and a title of conquest by the cross. Kings can become kings by
inheritance or by conquest. Our Lord, in His divine nature, is king by
inheritance, King of Kings. And by His cross, He is King of Kings by conquest over
the devil. He conquered the devil who had empire over the earth, and therefore Our
Lord has empire over the earth as having conquered the devil.

### The Hypostatic Union

The divine right of Our Lord is hypostatically stamped. What does that mean,
hypostatically? The hypostatic union is a technical term from the Greek word
*hypostasis*, which means first substance. The divine nature and the human nature
are united in the one substance, or one reality. It is like two coats hanging on
one peg; the two coats are united by hanging on the same peg. The two natures are
united by hanging on the same person or being. So, the hypostatic union is the
union of the divine and human natures, wrought at the very moment of Our Lord's
conception in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Hypostatically stamped means
it is stamped upon His human nature by its union with the divine nature in the
one person of the Word of God.

### The Angel in the Sun and the Great Supper

Verse 17: "And I saw an angel standing in the sun and cried out, he cried out
with a loud voice saying to all the birds which were flying through the middle of
the heaven, 'Come and gather together to the great supper of God.'"
An angel standing in the sun represents preachers of the gospel flooded in the
light of Christ. Remember, *angelos* means messenger in Greek. In the Book of the
Apocalypse, anyone who has a message is an *angelos* – it may be Our Lord
Himself, a human being, or what we would call an angel.

The birds are true Christians flying above the earth, trusting in God, flying
above earthly things and materialism. Consider Matthew 6:26: "Behold the birds of
the air, for they neither sow nor do they reap nor gather into barns: and your
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?" And
further on, regarding lilies: "Consider the lilies of the field how they grow:
they labour not neither do they spin. But I say to you, that not even Solomon in
all his glory was arrayed as one of these." So, the birds do not sow or reap, yet
the Heavenly Father looks after them. Therefore, the birds are those flying above
material things, trusting in God. Flying through the middle of the heaven, they
fly towards God, neither to the left nor to the right.

"Come and gather together for the great supper of God." The great supper is the
eternal wedding feast, the heavenly celebration Our Lord often speaks of,
especially in His parables. Heaven is compared to a wedding feast because a
wedding is most men's idea of a happy occasion. Classically, comedies end in a
wedding; it represents future, hope, and happiness. In any sane society, a
wedding is an occasion of rejoicing for everyone, not just the couple. Today, of
course, it is different, often a quick affair with few attendees because people
do not want to be tied down. So, nothing is right today.

### Converting the Nations

Verse 18: "In order that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of the
tribunes and the flesh of the strong and the flesh of the horses and those
sitting on them and the flesh of all freedmen and of slaves of little and of
great."
"Eat" here means to convert. Compare this to Saint Peter, who received a vision in
Acts 11 and was told to eat impure animals. The animals were declared no longer
impure, and he could eat them. This represented his converting the Gentiles. So,
to "eat" can mean to convert. True Christians come to the eternal wedding feast to
convert others.

The tribunes are those powerful by authority, like the constitutional officials
of the Roman Republic. The mighty are those powerful by wealth. The horses are
men, generous and impetuous, but who can be manipulated by riders. The free men
are libertarians, or what we would call Liberals today. And the slaves are
servants of sin.

### The Fate of the Beast and the Pseudo-Prophet

Verse 19: "And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies
gathered together to make war with him, who sat upon the horse and with his army."
The beast and the kings are the Antichrist and his lieutenants.
"And the beast was laid hold on, was taken, the beast was captured, and with him,
the pseudo-prophet." The pseudo-prophet is the false lamb of the second beast.
There is the dragon (Satan), the first beast (Antichrist), and the second beast
(the false church, the false lamb). The pseudo-prophet encompasses the false lamb,
the false church, and false churchmen.
"Who wrought signs before him, before the beast, wherewith he seduced them, who
received the character of the beast and who adored his image. These two were cast
alive into the pool of fire, burning with brimstone."
With the pseudo-prophet who wrought signs in his presence, he seduced those who
accepted the character of the beast and adored his image. The two were cast alive
into the pool of fire burning with sulfur. The pond of fire is the violent
punishment for the greatest criminals.

"And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the horse." The
followers of the two beasts, the Antichrist and the false church, are also
punished by Christ's judgment, the sword proceeding from His mouth.
"And all the birds were filled with their flesh." This means the followers of
Christ applauded Christ's judgment; they were satisfied. "Blessed are they that
hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied" (Matthew 5:6).

## Questions on Chapter 19

Any questions on chapter 19?

Birdie: In verse 15, "his thigh," what does it mean? Is there any particular
significance to the thigh?

Bishop Williamson: I don't know of any particular significance in the thigh beyond
it perhaps standing for strength, as it houses some of the strongest muscles in
the body.

Jenkins: When he made the sign, He took the Scepter from... [Jacob blessing Judah]
Genesis 49:10: "The Scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, nor a ruler from
his thigh, till he cometh that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of
nations."

Bishop Williamson: Yes, there may be a reference there. "Nor a ruler from his
thigh" I would think refers to physical descendants, which is not quite the same
thing here, as Our Lord had no physical descendants. It is stamped upon His human
nature. What was your other reference about thigh? Something about Jacob being
held in place with the angel's thigh? I think that might be a euphemism.

Darby: When Jacob wrestled with the angel, the angel touched his thigh, and he
limped from then onwards.

Bishop Williamson: Yes. I don't know if there is any connection there. I think it
just represents a strong part of the human frame.

Lester: Is the harlot of chapter 17 Babylon of chapter 18? It seems to be saying
at the end of chapter 17, "And the woman which thou sawest, is the great city..."
and then it goes on to talk about the Great City of Babylon.

Bishop Williamson: I would have to think about that. The harlot is basically
sensuality. Babylon stands for the world. "The kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the
power of her delicacies." Babylon is the world, and the woman is sensuality. They
are closely connected. To say whether they are exactly the same, I am not sure.
They are both symbols and might overlap to some extent, but they are different
symbols. The woman is more the flesh, and Babylon is more the world. The world,
the flesh, and the devil. A city is not identical with a woman riding on a beast;
one is the image of a city, and the other is an image of a human being.

## Interpreting Apocalypse Chapter 20: The Punishment of the Devil

Chapter 20 deals with the punishment of the devil. It describes the double defeat
of the devil. Verses 1 to 6 describe his defeat in AD 33 by the cross, and verses
7 to 14 describe his defeat at the end of the world.

### The Devil Bound for a Thousand Years

Verse 1: "And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
The angel is Christ, descending in His incarnation. Holding the key of the abyss
is the cross of Christ. Isaiah 22:22 says: "And I will lay the key of the house
of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and none shall shut: and he shall
shut, and none shall open." The key is the cross of Christ. The great chain is the
power of Christ to fix men in heaven or in hell. "In his hand" means this power
is at the disposal of His sacred humanity.

Verse 2: "And he laid hold on the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil
and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years." The dragon represents the strength of
Satan, and the serpent his cunning. The devil, from the Greek *diabolein*, means
to turn upside down, to throw apart; he is the introducer of duality and discord.
Satan is an Aramaic or Hebrew word meaning adversary, the essential enemy of all
good.

Christ bound Satan for a thousand years. By His passion, Christ prevented the
devil from doing all he wants and enabled all who wish to be saved.
Verse 3: "And cast him into the abyss and closed it and sealed it so that he
should no longer seduce the peoples until the 1,000 years are over, and after
this, it is appointed to him to be released for a little time."

### The Symbolic Meaning of the Thousand Years

The 1,000 years is not an exact figure but is symbolic of perfection, a perfect
length of time. It means here until the end of the world, when the Antichrist and
the devil will again be given great power.
It took the Church about 500 years, until about 500 AD, to, in a manner of
speaking, tie down the Roman Empire and the heretics, making Christendom
possible. Christendom lasted about a thousand years, perhaps from 500 to 1500.
Then Luther was let loose, and the Modern Age began, increasing its momentum all
the way to today, preparing for the Antichrist. So, one possible application of
the thousand years is the period from 500 to 1500. But the literal meaning here is
more general: the duration of time from Christ to the Antichrist, during which
anyone who wishes can be saved because the devil is essentially tied up. But at
the end, he will be given special power again.

### The Devil Unleashed in Modern Times

He has already been given a great deal of power in the modern world. Leo XIII saw
it in a vision in the 1880s. After Mass, he turned white as a sheet and said he
heard a dialogue between Satan and Christ, where Satan asked for more power, and
Christ granted him power for a hundred years. There is no question that Satan has
been especially let loose in the modern world, as a punishment for men's faults.
And he is doing as he likes today. Serious exorcists say his power is getting
greater and greater; he walks around as though the universe is his domain. Of
course, with most men he can do as he likes because they do not even believe he
exists—his masterstroke.

Even today, very few dioceses probably have an exorcist. In the old days, every
Catholic diocese would have a professional exorcist, which was very wise because
it is a specialized and dangerous role, tangling with the devil.

### Spiritual Warfare and Exorcism

#### The Role of the Exorcist
An exorcist needs experience. If a diocese has an exorcist, priests have someone
to send possessed souls to. The expert can first work out whether they are really
possessed, because some people, especially women, might think they are or want to
be possessed. Then the exorcist will deal with it. This is how it should be, so
the diocese has someone accustomed to dealing directly with the devil.

#### Archbishop Lefebvre on Dealing with the Demonic
Archbishop Lefebvre advised priests to be very careful about getting into
exorcisms. First, because the devil is so cunning, it takes someone with
experience, wisdom, and sanctity to tangle with him. Secondly, the devil takes
his revenge. In the famous Iowa case in Earling in 1928, the parish priest who
allowed an exorcism in his parish nearly got run off the road; the devil took over
his car and smashed it into a bridge. This is detailed in the Tan book, *Begone
Satan!*. He was targeted simply for allowing the exorcism. You are tangling with
major forces if the devil is really involved.

#### The Mass as the Greatest Exorcism
Archbishop Lefebvre used to say that if you are dealing with the devil, celebrate
the Mass. The greatest exorcism is the Mass. If a soul comes to you, the first
question is, "When did you last go to confession?" Confession drives out a lot of
devils because many accompany mortal sin. Also, how much does the soul pray? Are
they saying their prayers, especially the Rosary? Are they using holy water? If
they are doing all these things and still show symptoms, then it might be
possession. A sign of real possession is that they cannot stand holy water. If
they jump like a scalded cat when sprinkled, you may well have someone possessed.

The Archbishop taught that the Mass is, in this respect, completely safe and very
powerful. You say it for the person's intentions. It gets Our Lord involved, so
you do not run into the inconveniences of direct confrontation. There were young
priests spoiling for a fight, longing to mix it with the devil. Very unwise. He is
very smart, with an angelic intelligence, so you have got to be very careful.
