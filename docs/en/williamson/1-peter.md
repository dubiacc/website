Bishop Williamson unpacks the dating, authorship, and profound theological themes
of the First Epistle of Peter, emphasizing the Christian's lively hope in salvation.

# The Lively Hope of 1 Peter

Bishop Williamson explains that 1 Peter was likely written between 62 and 64/67 AD,
noting God's choice to leave many historical details obscure so believers focus on
essentials. He discusses the interplay of divine inspiration and human nature,
citing "grace builds on nature" and "whatever is received is received in the
manner of the receiver" to explain differences in apostolic writings. 

His grace establishes Rome as the place of writing, symbolized by "Babylon," and
outlines evidence for the epistle's early date, such as Paul's absence from Rome,
Mark's presence, the nature of Christian suffering (not yet bloody), the early
state of church hierarchy, and the expectation of the world's imminent end. He
then begins an exegesis of 1 Peter Chapter 1, highlighting its Trinitarian
structure, the "lively hope" through Christ's resurrection, the incorruptible
inheritance, being kept by faith, the trial of faith as more precious than gold,
and the salvation of souls as the ultimate goal. 

He emphasizes that this salvation was diligently searched for by Old Testament prophets who
ministered for future believers, to whom the full mystery has now been revealed by
the apostles through the Holy Spirit, a revelation into which even angels long
to look.

## Dating the Epistle of 1 Peter

### Initial Considerations

We are examining the First Epistle of Peter. Regarding its date, it was certainly
written before Peter died, so before 64 or 67 AD. It is interesting that God left
such details in so much obscurity. The Lord God could easily have provided more
details of the early Church, perhaps through a historian, but we only have
scattered hints. This might be so that we concentrate on essentials and not get
lost in accidental details.

The epistle was likely written before 64 or 67 AD, and after 62 AD, because of
certain reminiscences of Pauline epistles such as Romans, Ephesians, and perhaps
Hebrews. Hebrews was written around 62 AD, which is also the approximate date for
Luke's Gospel.

### Influence of Pauline Epistles and Divine Inspiration

These reminiscences from St. Paul's letters suggest that Paul wrote first, though
this is not conclusive. Paul might have drawn from Peter's preaching, or these
ideas were common among all apostles. It is possible Peter was picking them up from
St. Paul, who was more of an intellectual, a pupil of Gamaliel, and had certainly
done more book studies than the fishermen of Galilee. On the other hand, their
inspiration was equal.

### Grace Builds on Nature

St. Paul claims in Galatians that he received his Gospel from God through
revelation. This aligns with the principle *gratia aedificat super naturam*—grace
builds on nature. While St. Paul received his understanding from God, it promptly
meshed with everything he had learned from Gamaliel. What he learned from Gamaliel
was *natura* (nature), and the grace he received built upon this. The Lord God
took everything Gamaliel had instilled in Paul and supercharged it through the
Holy Ghost.

Similarly, when the same grace at Pentecost landed on Peter, everything natural in
him would have been seized by sanctifying grace and used. Perhaps Peter's preaching
included divinely inspired comparisons related to his experience as a fisherman.
Everything previously in Paul was also utilized by grace. Cardinal Newman, a
learned man in Scripture before his conversion, is another example; the Holy Ghost
made use of all he had. God undoubtedly chose Cardinal Newman for those specific
purposes.

### Quidquid Recipitur: The Manner of the Receiver

This illustrates a scholastic saying: *Quidquid recipitur ad modum recipientis
recipitur*—whatever is received is received in the manner of the receiver. All
twelve apostles received the same Holy Ghost, but what the Holy Ghost then worked
in twelve different souls depended upon what those twelve souls already possessed.
This is a very profound saying.

It is a variation upon the idea that how I react depends upon what I am. What I
will receive and react to depends upon what I am capable of receiving. What I am
capable of receiving depends upon what I am; therefore, how I act depends upon
what I am. This is fundamentally the same as *agere sequitur esse*—action follows
being.

These scholastic axioms, like *agere sequitur esse*, contain volumes. It's the
whole concept of nature, of a thing acting in accordance with its fixed nature.
Action necessarily proceeds in accordance with the nature of what is acting.
*Omne agens agit secundum quod est in actu* (Every agent acts according as it is
in act), or *Omne agens agit per suam formam* (Every agent acts through its form).
These relate to the primacy of being. The modern world, by contrast, often
emphasizes the primacy of doing, as exemplified in Goethe's Faust, which alters
"In the beginning was the Word" to "In the beginning was Action."

## Further Confirmations for Dating (62-67 AD Window)

Several factors tend to confirm this window of 62 to 64/67 AD for 1 Peter.

### 1. Paul is No Longer in Rome

His first captivity has likely ended, and he is possibly in Spain on his last
missionary journey. There is no reference to Paul in 1 Peter, even though Peter is
writing to churches founded by Paul. This suggests Paul is out of the picture at
that moment.

### 2. Mark is in Rome

1 Peter 5:13 indicates Mark is in Rome. This aligns with Colossians 4:10, where
Paul mentions Mark, cousin of Barnabas, and foresees Mark potentially making a
journey to Asia. It appears Mark is still in Rome at the time of 1 Peter's
writing.

### 3. Christians are Suffering, But Not Yet in Blood

The epistle shows Christians are suffering, but not yet "unto blood" (*Nondum usque
ad sanguinem restitistis*, cf. Hebrews 12:4). The first major Neronian
persecution, involving bloody martyrdoms, is generally dated to 64 AD. If it began
in 64 AD, Peter writing before this, say in 62 or 63 AD, would explain why there is
no mention of bloody suffering. Instead, Peter encourages respect for authorities,
which might be phrased differently if those authorities were actively executing
Christians. This suggests a date before widespread, bloody persecution.

### 4. Christians are Neophytes, Church Hierarchy in Early State

The Christians addressed seem to be relatively new converts (neophytes). The
Church's hierarchy appears to be in an early state, with communities governed by
presbyters, suggesting higher apostolic authority is still directly overseeing them.
While the reality of pope, bishops, and priests exists from the Gospels (apostles
as bishops, disciples as priests, Peter as pope), the distinct terminology like
*episkopoi* (bishops) and *presbyteroi* (priests) is not yet clearly differentiated,
as also seen in Paul's epistles. This points to an earlier rather than later date.

### 5. Expectation of the Imminent End of the World

The Christians still seem to think the end of the world is close, which is
characteristic of an earlier stage in the Church's understanding.

These are minor confirmations pointing to an early date. We are barely 30 years
since Our Lord was crucified; the events of Golgotha are still very recent.

## Place of Writing: Rome as "Babylon"

The epistle was written in Rome, referred to as "Babylon" in 1 Peter 5:13. This
was a classic comparison for several reasons:

1.  **Shared Characteristics:** Both Babylon and Rome were known for idolatry,
    immorality, and a crushing imperial power. Virgil’s Aeneid captures Rome’s
    imperial mindset: *"Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento... parcere
    subiectis et debellare superbos"* (Thou, O Roman, remember to rule the peoples
    by thy empire... to spare the conquered and to subdue the proud by war). This
    crushing nature of Rome is also seen in Daniel's prophecy of the fourth empire
    of iron.
2.  **Ancient Interpretation:** All ancient writers understood "Babylon" in this
    context to mean Rome. Erasmus in the late 1400s was among the first to
    disagree. (St. Ignatius of Loyola noted that reading Erasmus made him less
    fervent, so he stopped.)
3.  **Peter's Location:** There is no historical record or indication that Peter was
    ever near the literal Babylon in Mesopotamia.

Everything indicates that "Babylon" in 1 Peter 5:13 signifies Rome.

## Content and Structure of 1 Peter

The epistle can be broadly seen in five parts: a prologue, an exaltation of
holiness, special duties of Christians, instructions on behavior within Christian
communities, and an epilogue. However, an epistle is not like the Summa Theologica;
it's not as rigidly structured as some might try to make it.

## Exegesis of 1 Peter, Chapter 1

We now come to the text itself.

### 1 Peter 1:1-2: Salutation and Trinitarian Blessing

> "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus,
> Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect, according to the foreknowledge
> of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
> sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you and peace be multiplied."

Peter addresses the "elect," those chosen out, who are foreigners scattered
throughout these regions. Verse two is clearly Trinitarian, mentioning the Father,
the Spirit (Holy Ghost), and the Son (Jesus Christ), even if the explicit Trinitarian
terminology isn't there.

*   **God the Father's foreknowledge** is the efficient cause of election (virtual
    salvation).
*   **The sanctification of the Spirit** is the formal cause of election.
*   **Obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ** (the Son) is the
    meritorious cause.

"Grace unto you and peace (shalom) be multiplied."

### 1 Peter 1:3-5: Regeneration, Hope, and Heavenly Inheritance

This introduction is dense, reminiscent of some parts of St. Paul's writings.

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his
> great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of
> Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
> and that cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you, who, by the power of God,
> are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.

We hope because Christ rose from the dead. God has regenerated us for that which
the resurrection makes us hope for: an incorruptible, undefiled, unfading
inheritance reserved in heaven—salvation. This language of "inheritance" or
"heritage" of hope is very Pauline.

"You, who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation." It is God's
doing that Christians are Christian and persevere. Faith is the indispensable
foundation, the beginning; salvation is the final purpose, the end. If faith fails,
salvation is sure to fail. This salvation is "ready to be revealed in the last
time," reflecting the perspective that Christ came towards the end of the world,
revealing what lay hidden.

### 1 Peter 1:6-7: Joy Amidst Trials, Faith Tested by Fire

> Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made
> sorrowful in diverse temptations: That the trial of your faith, much more
> precious than gold (which is tried by the fire), may be found unto praise and
> glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

If you make it to salvation in heaven, you will be enormously happy, even if now
you must endure difficulties and diverse temptations for a little time.
Your faith is being tried. Gold, which is precious, is purified by fierce fire to
burn away impurities. Faith, much more precious than gold, should likewise be
expected to be tried by fierce persecution. This trial of faith, if found true,
will result in praise, glory, and honor at the "appearing of Jesus Christ"
(particular and general judgment). This glory is first to God, by whose grace it
is achieved, and also to those who cooperated with His grace.

### 1 Peter 1:8-9: Loving the Unseen Christ, Salvation of Souls

> Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now, though you see him not, you
> believe: and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;
> Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

You do not see Christ now; you live by faith. Though you see Him not, you love Him
and believe in Him. If you persevere and make it to heaven, you will "rejoice with
joy unspeakable and glorified," receiving the "end of your faith"—its purpose—which
is the salvation of your souls.
Peter is zeroing in on the one thing that matters: salvation. It is what Jesus
Christ was about, what the Christian life is about, and what trials and
temptations are about. And it all depends upon, and is grounded in, faith.

### 1 Peter 1:10-12: Salvation Foretold by Prophets, Revealed to Believers

> Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who
> prophesied of the grace that should come unto you. Searching what or what manner
> of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify: when it foretold those
> sufferings that are in Christ and the glories that should follow. To whom it was
> revealed that not to themselves but to you they ministered those things which
> are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, the Holy
> Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.

This salvation was foreseen by the Old Testament prophets. They inquired and
diligently searched, longing to see what has now been revealed to ordinary
Gentile believers. This reminds us of Our Lord's words that Abraham rejoiced to
see His day (John 8:56), and that many prophets and kings desired to see what the
disciples were seeing (Luke 10:24). You, the recipients of this epistle, are the
realization of these ancient and glorious prophecies.

The "Spirit of Christ" in the prophets (referring to the Holy Ghost) suggests the
procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son (Christ), as taught by the Latin Church's
*Filioque*. This Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ (e.g., Psalm 22, Isaiah
53—the suffering servant) and the glories that would follow.

It was revealed to these Old Testament prophets that they were ministering not for
themselves but for *you*—for future believers in the Church of Jesus Christ. They
were working for the Church, glimpsing, dreaming of, and longing for the mysteries
that have now been fully declared to you by the apostles who preached the Gospel—
such as Paul, Barnabas, Mark, Clement. The Old Testament prophets were
half-seeing and longing for those mysteries which have now been openly revealed
to you. This idea is also clear in Hebrews 1:1-2: "God, who at sundry times and in
diverse manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,
in these days has spoken to us by his Son." The Son is the fullness of revelation.

These things are now declared "the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven." This
is an ablative absolute in Latin, signifying the Holy Ghost *having been* sent down
from heaven to inspire with the fullness of revelation.
"On whom the angels desire to look." You are being given the full view of that
which even the angels themselves desire to see. Through the Old Testament prophets
at half-power, and through the apostles at full-power, you receive the revelation
of God's complete message, given by the Holy Ghost, whom even the angels do not
fully see in this way.

Peter is emphasizing the immense significance—the "biggie"—of your Catholic life,
the Catholic Church, the state of grace, and the redemption by Our Lord Jesus
Christ.
