## Fr. Hesse

Gregorius Hesse, whose full name was Gregorius Henricus Laurentius 
Diego Dagobertus Hervinus Hesse, was born on June 27, 1953, in Vienna. 
His uncle was the pastor of St. Rochus in Vienna, Prelate Erwin Hesse.

Gregorius Hesse initially studied Engineering and Economics in Vienna 
and, as a work-study student, also spent some time at the Farbenwerk 
Frankfurt-Hoechst (paint factory/dye works) and at Mercedes in Sindelfingen.

In 1976, he decided to go to Rome to become a priest. He studied at 
the "Angelicum" and earned his doctorate in Theology and Canon Law.
On November 21, 1981, he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Aurelio 
Sabattani in St. Peter's Basilica. Although the New Rite was used, 
Dr. Hesse was convinced of the validity of his ordination.

From 1986 to 1988, he worked as secretary to Cardinal Alfons Maria Stickler, 
then until 1991 in the Papal Secret Archives.

During this time, Dr. Hesse witnessed the decline of the Catholic faith 
in Rome and recognized that the New Liturgy was primarily responsible 
for it. Therefore, soon after his priestly ordination, he celebrated 
Mass only according to the Tridentine Rite. When Cardinal Stickler 
retired in 1991, he considered further work in Rome to be pointless 
and returned to Vienna.

In his apartment on Scheibenbergerstra√üe, he lived from then on without 
a secure income, supporting himself through translation work and lecture 
tours that took him all over Europe and, almost every year, across the 
United States of America for several weeks.

On the night of January 24-25, 2006, Dr. Hesse suffered a severe stroke 
in his apartment due to complications from his diabetes, and he died 
from its effects in the hospital that same day.

He was buried on February 16, 2006, in the Vienna Central Cemetery.
