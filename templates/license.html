    A majority of the website and icon design was ripped from Gwern Branwens site 
    gwern.net and adapted to multilingual needs of this site. While about 90% of the 
    code was changed and removed (due to some features being completely unnecessary 
    for a theological site, search functionality, etc.), the dubia.cc team would 
    still like to thank Gwern for open-sourcing his CSS.

    Some of the other functionality was written with Claude and Gemini, particularly
    analyzing YouTube transcripts of sermons and the. If you have a potential copyright 
    problem, please don't hesistate to email us at info@dubia.cc.

    Fonts used are Kanzlei Initialen by Dieter Steffmann (steffman.de). Since the 
    author heavily complained about the price of having to purchase fonts back in the 90s,
    we assume that these fonts are public domain / free of charge.

    The main font used is Source Serif Pro by Adobe.

    The hosting is done by Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages for free.

    All of the content, sermons, is usually provided in the Public Domain: we include
    links to the original authors website, but usually the people we cite are already dead.
    So there's no real point. dubia.cc merely re-publishes, re-formats and sources
    articles (such as verifying claims made in sermons). Then we provide the "main author"
    of the article as the "author" (while adding donation buttons if the user wants it).

    While we always try to cite sources properly, errors can occur. 

    Please email info@dubia.cc if you find an error, have a question about an article
    or see a potention theological error.
